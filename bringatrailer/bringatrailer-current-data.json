      "This 1988 Porsche 911 Turbo cabriolet is a factory M505 slant nose example that was acquired by the current owner in 2007. It is powered by a turbocharged 3.3-liter flat-six paired with a four-speed manual transaxle and is finished in Guards Red over Champagne special leather. The car is equipped with a power-operated black soft top, a limited-slip differential, 17″ BBS wheels, air conditioning, a roll bar, a three-spoke steering wheel, and heated and power-adjustable seats. Work performed in preparation for the sale included adjusting the valves, recharging the air conditioning system, and replacing the oil cooler fan, spark plugs, and valve cover gaskets. This M505 930 Turbo is offered on dealer consignment with a Porsche Certificate of Authenticity, an owner’s manual, service records, a car cover, an accident-free Carfax report, and a clean California title.",
      "The car is finished in Guards Red and is equipped with factory flachbau bodywork (M505), a package that featured pop-up headlights, vented front fenders, side strakes, and extended side sills. Additional equipment includes a black convertible soft top, fog lights, and twin exhaust outlets. The right windshield washer nozzle was replaced and the convertible top was repaired in preparation for the sale. Imperfections are highlighted in a document shown in the gallery below, which also includes photos of paint meter readings.",
      "The 17″ BBS wheels are mounted with 225/45 front and 265/40 rear Michelin Pilot Sport tires. Braking is handled by four-wheel cross-drilled and ventilated discs. The brake hoses were replaced and the brake fluid was flushed in preparation for the sale.",
      "The heated and power-adjustable front seats are upholstered in Champagne special leather and are complemented by a color-coordinated center console, carpeting, and door panels. Amenities include air conditioning, an analog clock, and power windows. A roll bar, metal pedals, Pioneer and JVC stereos, and an amplifier have been added, and the seller notes that an aftermarket alarm system is installed. The driver’s seat switch was replaced in 2023.",
      "The three-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel frames VDO instrumentation including a central tachometer with a 6,700-rpm redline as well as a 170-mph speedometer and gauges for oil pressure, oil temperature, oil level, fuel level, and boost pressure. The six-digit odometer shows 44k miles, approximately 4k of which were added under current ownership. The odometer drive gear was replaced in 2020, and total mileage is unknown.",
      "The turbocharged 3.3-liter flat-six was factory rated at 282 horsepower and 278 lb-ft of torque. The battery was replaced in 2021. Service in preparation for the sale included performing an oil change, adjusting the valves, servicing the air conditioning system, and replacing the oil cooler fan, spark plugs, and valve cover gaskets.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels via a four-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. The clutch disc was replaced in 2018.",
      "The Porsche Certificate of Authenticity lists colors, optional equipment, and a production completion date of December 2, 1987.",
      "The Carfax report is free of accidents and other damage.",
      "The car was designated a Gross Polluter by the State of California in 2016, and it last passed a California emissions test in June 2024."

This 718 Cayman GT4 RS was acquired by the selling dealer in 2024 and is now offered with an accident-free Carfax report and a clean Florida title.",
      "The 718 GT4 RS features lightweight rear glass, vented front fenders, additional upper intakes, and a larger swan-neck rear wing when compared with the contemporary 718 GT4. Weissach Package-equipped cars are denoted by titanium tailpipes as well as exposed carbon-fiber weave on the hood, intakes, side mirror housings, and wing. This example is finished in Arctic Gray and is fitted with bi-xenon headlights, power-folding side mirrors, ParkAssist rear parking sensors, carbon-fiber window triangles, and integrated dual exhaust outlets exiting through the rear diffuser.",
      "The 20″ forged magnesium wheels are mounted with staggered-width Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires. A front-axle lift system was optioned from the factory, and stopping power is provided by four-wheel dimpled and ventilated discs.",
      "The carbon-fiber full bucket seats are upholstered in black leather with Deep Sea Blue Race-Tex inserts, “Weissach RS” headrest embroidery, blue seatbelts, and color-contrasting stitching that extends to the dashboard, center console, steering column, and door panels. Appointments include carbon-fiber trim, dual-zone automatic climate control, carbon-fiber illuminated door sill guards, a Bose sound system, Shark Blue door pulls, a fire extinguisher, and PCM infotainment with navigation. The optional Light Design Package added LED lighting in the overhead console, door handles, door storage compartments, footwells, and vanity mirrors.",
      "The Race-Tex-wrapped steering wheel features a yellow centering stripe and fronts a central tachometer with a 9k-rpm redline flanked by a 200-mph speedometer and a configurable digital display. The optional Chrono Package added a stopwatch atop the dashboard. The digital odometer indicates 58 miles.",

      "This 2021 BMW R nineT Pure underwent modifications at Angel Motoworks (formerly BAAK USA) of Los Angeles that included fitting a custom two-into-two exhaust system, LED lights, and a leather tank pouch in addition to tuning the engine, powder-coating the valve covers, and removing the airbox and rear fender. The bike is finished in gray and is powered by an 1,170cc opposed twin paired with a six-speed transmission and enclosed driveshaft. This R nineT is now offered at no reserve with service records and a clean California title in the seller’s name.",
      "The motorcycle is finished in gray and has been modified with a fender-eliminator and license-plate bracket kit, LED turn signals, an LED brake light, aluminum mirrors, and a black leather tank pouch. The bike has a two-up seat and a side stand.",
      "Black-finished 17″ alloy wheels wear ZR-rated Michelin tires. Suspension consists of a 43mm conventional fork in addition to a monoshock attached to the Paralever single-sided swingarm. Braking is from Brembo calipers mounted over a pair of floating 320mm discs up front as well as a BMW-branded caliper fitted over a 265mm rotor at the rear, and the motorcycle is equipped with BMW Motorrad ABS.",
      "The aluminum one-piece handlebar fronts a 140-mph speedometer with a built-in digital display that contains an odometer showing 8k miles, 7,500 of which were ridden by the seller.",
      "The air-cooled 1,170cc opposed-twin factory-rated output was 110 horsepower and features an oil cooler, oil-cooled cylinder heads, fuel injection, and four valves per cylinder. A custom two-into-two exhaust system with a crossover pipe has been fitted, and additional modifications include powder-coating the valve covers black, removing the air box, and performing tuning work. An oil change and valve clearance check was carried out in September 2023.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheel via a six-speed transmission and an enclosed driveshaft.",
      "Engine number A72B12A51206378 is shown above. The engine number listed on the California title document, A728B12A51206378, adds an “8” between the “2” and “B.”"

      "This 1972 Chevrolet C10 Cheyenne pickup was purchased new by the seller’s father at Grant Bishop Chevrolet of Los Gatos, California, and has remained under their care since. Power is provided by a 350ci V8 mated to a three-speed automatic transmission, and the truck is finished in Dark Olive over green vinyl upholstery. A color-keyed camper shell and aftermarket exhaust system components have been added, and additional equipment includes 15″ Rally wheels, power steering, a tow ball, air conditioning, and an AM radio. This C10 pickup is now offered by the seller on behalf of their father with manufacturer’s literature, initial purchase documentation, service records, and a clean California title in the name of the owner’s trust.",
      "The truck left the factory finished in Dark Olive, and records provided in the gallery indicate that it was repainted in April 1995. A color-keyed camper shell has been added, and it features sliding side windows and fold-down cots while carpeting lines the floor of the cargo bed. Additional exterior details include a chrome grille and bumpers, dual side mirrors, and bodyside moldings with woodgrain inlays as well as a tow ball accompanied by a seven-pin trailer hookup.",
      "The 15″ Rally wheels feature green-painted centers and chrome accents, and they are mounted with 235/70 Uniroyal Tiger Paw GTS tires. The truck is equipped with power steering, and braking is provided by power-assisted front discs and rear drums.",
      "The cabin houses a bench seat upholstered in green vinyl as well as color-coordinated door panels with woodgrain trim. Air conditioning was optioned from the factory, and other equipment includes an AM radio, a fire extinguisher, crank-operated windows, and a green vinyl floor mat. The door panel armrests are worn and photos provided in the gallery show deterioration of the driver-door weather seal. The air conditioning system does not blow cold.",
      "The two-spoke steering wheel is cracked in the center and wears an aftermarket wrap. Instrumentation consists of a 100-mph speedometer and gauges for fuel level, amperage, coolant temperature, and oil pressure. The five-digit odometer shows 57k miles. True mileage is unknown.",
      "The 350ci V8 was factory rated at 175 horsepower and 290 lb-ft of torque. Aftermarket exhaust headers have been installed, and they feed into a dual exhaust system with Flowmaster mufflers. An aftermarket horn shown in photos has been removed.",
      "Power is routed to the rear wheels through a three-speed Turbo Hydramatic automatic transmission.",

      "This 2012 Porsche 911 Carrera S cabriolet was ordered new by the seller’s father, who specified Basalt Black Metallic paintwork over a two-tone Black and Platinum Grey leather interior. The car was optioned with the Premium Package Plus and a Burmester sound system as well as a switchable sport exhaust system, ParkAssist, Voice Control, Power Steering Plus, and a multifunction steering wheel. Power is from a 3.8-liter flat-six linked with a seven-speed manual transaxle, a limited-slip differential, and Porsche Torque Vectoring. Work within the last year has included replacing the battery, lower oil sump, spark plugs, alarm module, and brake fluid. This 991.1 has 49k miles following its acquisition by the seller approximately two years ago, and it is now offered with records, a window sticker, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Washington title in the seller’s name.",
      "The car is finished in Basalt Black Metallic and features bi-xenon headlights, fog lights, front and rear parking sensors, LED taillights, and a speed-activated rear spoiler. The seller notes that a parking-lot incident approximately 11 years ago resulted in repainting the rear fascia. The front valance shows a pair of scrapes on the lower lip. Rock chips are also noted up front, and the replacement windshield has a rock chip in the lower-center area.",
      "The 20″ Carrera S alloy wheels have full-color center caps and are mounted with Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires. Braking is handled by red-painted Porsche-branded calipers over cross-drilled and ventilated discs. The car is equipped with Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM). The brake fluid was flushed in July 2024.",
      "The Black and Platinum Grey leather interior features the Premium Package Plus, which included heated and ventilated 14-way adjustable sport seats. Other options include a Burmester sound system, Voice Control, and Porsche crests for the front-seat headrests. The outer driver’s seat bolsters show signs of wear. The alarm module was updated in June 2023.",
      "The leather-wrapped multifunction steering wheel frames a gray-dial tachometer with a 7,600-rpm redline as well as a 200-mph speedometer, a digital display, and gauges for oil temperature, oil pressure, coolant temperature, and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 49k miles, approximately 1,600 of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The 3.8-liter flat-six was factory rated at 400 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque. The lower-engine oil sump and seals were replaced and an oil change was performed in July 2024, and the spark plugs were replaced at that time. The battery and lid struts were replaced in June 2023.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a seven-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential with Porsche Torque Vectoring. The car was optioned with a switchable sport exhaust system that can be controlled via a button in the center console.",
      "The window sticker lists initial delivery to Porsche North Scottsdale in Phoenix, Arizona, as well as factory colors, equipment, and a total price of $129,210.",
      "The Carfax report shows no accidents or damage."

Other details include a dual-mode exhaust system, aftermarket engine management software, a UUC Motorwerks short shifter, an X5-sourced infotainment system, and aftermarket speakers. This M5-style E39 Sport Wagon is offered in New York on dealer consignment at no reserve with an owner’s manual, service records, a Carfax report, and a clean Minnesota title.",

The hood, fenders, bumpers, and side mirrors were repainted in 2019, and areas of touch-up paint are noted. The tailgate struts were replaced in 2023. A cover is missing from the front bumper cover, there is chipped paint on the rear bumper cover, and an area of corrosion is noted on the lower tailgate.",

      "This 1985 Porsche 911 Carrera coupe is powered by a 3.2-liter flat-six paired with a 915 five-speed manual transaxle and is finished in black over black leather. Equipment includes sport shocks, 16″ Fuchs alloy wheels, a power-operated sunroof, a power-adjustable driver seat, air conditioning, cruise control, and a Porshe Classic stereo with navigation. The current owner purchased the car in 2018 and subsequent work included resealing the engine, reprogramming the ECU, repairing the sunroof, and replacing the clutch, engine temperature sensor, idle contact switch, fuel injectors, headliner, and seats. This Carrera coupe shows 95k miles and is offered by the seller on behalf of the current owner with a Porsche Production Specification Certificate, an owner’s manual, a tool kit, service records, a Carfax report, and a clean Washington title in the owner’s name.",
      "The car was refinished under previous ownership in black and features fog lights, headlight washers, heated power-adjustable side mirrors, a power-operated sunroof, and black rear bumperettes. The Carfax report notes a theft and recovery in February 2012 as well as a damage report indicating that the car hit a sign. The front hood struts were replaced under current ownership.",
      "The 16″ Fuchs alloy wheels are mounted with 205/55 front and 225/50 rear Continental ExtremeContact tires. The car was optioned with sport shocks, and braking is handled by four-wheel discs. Work in 2021 included replacing the front rotors, brake pads, wheel seals, and tie rods. Blemishes are visible on the finish of the wheels.",
      "The replacement front bucket seats and individual rear seats are upholstered in black leather. Appointments include air conditioning, cruise control, power windows, central locking, and a Porsche Classic stereo with navigation. Work under current ownership included repairing the sunroof and replacing the blower motor, driver-side passenger window switch, window seals, and headliner. The power-adjustable controls for the passenger seat are inoperative.",
      "The leather-wrapped MOMO Prototipo steering wheel frames VDO instrumentation including a central tachometer with a 6,300-rpm redline as well as a 170-mph speedometer, a Quarz clock, and gauges for oil level, oil pressure, oil temperature, and fuel level. The six-digit odometer shows 95k miles, approximately 15k of which were added under current ownership. The fuel level sender was replaced in 2022.",
      "The 3.2-liter M930/21 flat-six was factory rated at 202 horsepower and 185 lb-ft of torque and features a Dansk muffler. Work under current ownership included resealing the engine, reprogramming the ECU, and replacing the cylinder head temperature sensor, idle contact switch, distributor rotor and cap, and fuel injectors. An oil return line was replaced and an oil change was performed in preparation for the sale. Results from a compression test are presented in the gallery.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a Type 915 five-speed manual transaxle. The clutch disc was replaced in 2020.",
      "The Porsche Production Specification Certificate lists a production completion date of October 22, 1984, along with colors and options.",
      "The Carfax report shows the aforementioned theft, recovery, and damage report in February 2012 and lists history in New York and Washington from the initial entry in April 1992.",

Further modifications include a nitrous oxide system, a Crane camshaft, KB pistons, and Hooker headers in addition to tubbed rear wheel wells, 15″ Budnik wheels, Strange axles, and a Flaming River steering rack. The bodywork is finished in blue with white stripes and mounted to a fabricated chassis. A fuel cell and components for the nitrous oxide system are located in the trunk, and the interior houses a roll cage and fixed-back bucket seats equipped with safety harnesses as well as a Grant steering wheel, AutoMeter instrumentation, a Hurst shifter, and a fire extinguisher. Acquired by the seller in 2006, this Pro Street Camaro is now offered with a seller-provided build sheet, spare rear wheels, and a New Jersey title in the seller’s name.",

      "This 1972 Chevrolet K5 Blazer 4×4 was purchased by the owner in 2018 and subsequently refurbished with work that included refinishing the body in Olive Green with a white removable hardtop as well as rebuilding the 350ci V8. A three-speed automatic transmission is accompanied by a dual-range transfer case, both of which were reportedly overhauled and connected to rebuilt differentials via custom-fabricated driveshafts. The interior is trimmed in Olive, and additional equipment includes an AM radio, a center console, a 4″ lift kit, power-assisted steering and brakes, and Warn locking front hubs as well as an Edelbrock intake manifold, a Holley carburetor, a COMP Cams camshaft, and Dart cylinder heads. This K5 Blazer is now offered on dealer consignment in Arizona with a spare set of four polished Mickey Thompson wheels and an Idaho title.",
      "The truck was refinished in Dark Olive Green following rust repair in the rocker panels during the refurbishment. The removable hardtop was refinished in white, and additional details include woodgrain tailgate and bodyside trim, dual side mirrors, and chrome bumpers. The seller states the frame was stripped and powder-coated black.",
      "White-painted 15″ wheels are mounted with 33×12.5″ BFGoodrich All-Terrain T/A tires, and the truck is also pictured with an included set of four polished Mickey Thompson wheels. The seller states that the Warn front hubs were rebuilt, a Skyjacker 4″ lift was installed, a later-model K5 Blazer sway bar was installed, the steering box mounting area was reinforced, and the steering gearbox and pump were rebuilt during the refurbishment.",
      "The cabin features front bucket seats upholstered in Olive vinyl with houndstooth cloth inserts. Interior appointments include a body-color dash panel, a center console, faux woodgrain door panel accents, and a push-button radio. The seller notes the seat foam was replaced and the seats were reupholstered during the refurbishment.",
      "The two-spoke steering wheel frames a 100-mph speedometer alongside gauges for fuel level, battery charge, coolant temperature, and oil pressure. The five-digit odometer shows 44k miles, approximately 1k of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The 350ci V8 was reportedly machined and rebuilt using forged pistons, Dart cast-iron cylinder heads, a COMP Cams hydraulic roller camshaft, and roller rocker arms. Additional equipment includes an Edelbrock aluminum intake manifold, a Holley four-barrel carburetor, MSD ignition components, and coated cast-iron exhaust manifolds that flow into a ceramic-coated exhaust system with a Flowmaster muffler.",
      "Power is routed to the rear or all four wheels through a TH350 three-speed automatic transmission and a dual-range transfer case, both of which were rebuilt during the refurbishment along with the front and rear differentials according to the seller. The front driveshaft has been lengthened and rebuilt, and the rear driveshaft is a custom-fabricated unit with a CV joint at the transfer case."

      "This 1995 Porsche 911 Carrera coupe was first delivered to Harper’s Porsche in Knoxville, Tennessee. It was purchased new by its current owner, and it has 56k miles following registration history in the state. Finished in Guards Red over Cashmere leather, the car is powered by a 3.6-liter flat-six paired with a six-speed manual transaxle. Equipment includes Bilstein coilovers, aftermarket sway bars, 17″ Cup II wheels, a power-operated sunroof, power-adjustable front seats, cruise control, a cassette stereo, and air conditioning. This 993 Carrera coupe is now offered on dealer consignment with a window sticker, the owner’s manual, service records, a tool kit, an air compressor, and a clean Tennessee title.",
      "The car is finished in Guards Red and features headlight washers, fog lights, power-adjustable mirrors, a power-operated sunroof, a speed-activated rear spoiler, and dual exhaust outlets. Wiring for trailer brake lights has been added. The Carfax report indicates that an accident occurred in October 2002, and damage is noted in an October 2020 entry. The rear bumper was repainted and a taillight was replaced in 2002, per the selling dealer. Photos in the gallery depict finish imperfections.",
      "Silver-finished 17″ Cup II wheels are mounted with Michelin Pilot Sport tires. Braking is handled by Porsche-branded calipers over cross-drilled rotors at all four corners. Bilstein coilovers have been added, and additional suspension modifications include aftermarket sway bars, adjustable drop links, and monoball camber plates.",
      "The power-adjustable front seats are upholstered in Cashmere leather and complemented by a color-coordinated center console, door panels, and carpeting. Amenities include cruise control, a CR-1 cassette stereo, and power windows. Wear is evident on the driver’s seat and on the shift knob. The air conditioning system’s blower was replaced in 2022.",
      "The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames VDO instrumentation including a central tachometer with a 6,800-rpm redline, a 180-mph speedometer, an analog clock, and gauges for oil pressure, oil temperature, oil level, and fuel level. The six-digit odometer shows 56k miles.",
      "The air-cooled 3.6L flat-six was factory rated at 270 horsepower and 243 lb-ft of torque. The battery was replaced in August 2022, and the oil was changed in preparation for the sale.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels via a six-speed manual transaxle. The transaxle was rebuilt and the clutch was replaced at 50k miles in March 2009.",
      "The window sticker lists initial delivery to Harper’s Porsche in Knoxville, Tennessee, along with factory equipment, colors, and a total price of $63,147. The sale also includes service records, a tool kit, and an air compressor.",
      "The Carfax report shows the aforementioned accident and damage report. It also indicates that a duplicate title was issued in September 2019, though the seller states that this is an error.",

      "This 1971 Triumph TR6 was refurbished under prior ownership and was acquired by the current owner on BaT in September 2019. The car is powered by a 302ci Ford V8 linked to a Tremec T5 five-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential, and it is finished in light blue over black upholstery. Additional equipment includes an Edelbrock carburetor, a Griffin radiator, a Centerforce clutch, 16″ Konig wheels, Wilwood front disc brakes, a black soft top, and a Clarion stereo. This TR6 is offered on dealer consignment with service records and New Hampshire registration.",
      "The body was reportedly sand-blasted and rust was repaired before the car was repainted light blue under prior ownership. Equipment includes a front spoiler, chrome bumpers, and dual exhaust outlets. The seller notes separation between the right-rear window and the black vinyl soft top.",
      "The 16″ Konig Rewind wheels are mounted with Falken tires, and the front tires are said to rub when the steering wheel is fully turned. Braking is from Wilwood discs up front, drums out back, and a Master Brakes master cylinder with a Wilwood proportioning valve.",
      "The heated bucket seats were reportedly sourced from a Mazda Miata, and they are trimmed in black leather. Additional equipment includes a Clarion stereo head unit, a wood shift knob, and a Mr. Roadster gas pedal with a Lokar cable. The transmission tunnel has been widened, which reduced the size of the pedal box.",
      "The Moto-Lita wood-rimmed steering wheel fronts a wood dashboard with AutoMeter gauges. The digital odometer shows 1,700 miles, approximately 200 of which were added under current ownership. Total mileage is unknown.",
      "The 302ci Ford V8 crate engine was installed under prior ownership, and it is reportedly equipped with aluminum cylinder heads, an Edelbrock carburetor and fuel pump, a Griffin radiator, and a Dynomax Turbo exhaust system. The fuel lines were replaced under current ownership.",
      "The Tremec five-speed manual transmission is said to feature a Centerforce clutch, a Wilwood master clutch cylinder, and a Tilton hydraulic throw-out bearing. Additional equipment includes aftermarket axles and a limited-slip rear differential. The frame was reinforced under prior ownership.",
      "The car does not have a title, as it is registered in a state that does not issue titles for a vehicle of its age. It is being sold on its registration."

    "description": [
      "This 1991 BMW 325iX sedan is a Canadian-market example that is powered by a 2.5-liter M20 inline-six paired with a four-speed automatic transmission and is finished in Sterling Silver Metallic over Indigo leather.  Equipment includes an all-wheel drive system, 15″ basketweave alloy wheels, fog lights, a sunroof, heated front seats, a MOMO steering wheel, cruise control, and a CD stereo. The car has remained registered in British Columbia since new and was acquired by the seller in 2022.  Subsequent work performed involved replacing suspension components as well as the water pump, timing belt, drive belts, fuel pump, and fuel filter. Now showing 205k kilometers (~127k miles), this E30 sedan is now offered in Canada with an owner’s manual, service records for work performed under current ownership, US and Canadian Carfax reports, and British Columbia registration in the seller’s name.",
      "The 325iX features flared wheel arches and side skirts to accommodate a 9mm wider track and more deeply offset wheels when compared with the standard 325i. This example is finished in Sterling Silver Metallic (244) and features aluminum trim, quad headlights, fog lights, a sunroof, a decklid spoiler, an antenna, and iX-specific body-color rocker panel and wheel-arch extensions. Blemishes include bubbles in the paint on the left front fender, cracks in the front and rear bumper covers, and paint blemishes on various body panels. The Carfax Canada report lists incidences of theft in April 1994 and again in September 1999, and also notes multiple collision reports from December 1992 through November 2006.",
      "Silver 15″ basketweave alloy wheels are mounted with 195/60 Maxtrek Relamax 4s tires. Braking is handled by ventilated front and solid rear discs with a Bosch ABS system that was revised for use in the iX. The shocks and struts were replaced in November 2022.",
      "The heated front seats are upholstered in Indigo leather and are joined by color-coordinated door panels and carpets. A heater, an onboard computer, cruise control, BMW-branded floor mats, and a Kenwood CD stereo are additional details. The seller notes the air conditioning system does not work and that the low coolant light remains illuminated.",
      "The MOMO Prototipo steering wheel frames a 240-km/h speedometer, a tachometer, and auxiliary gauges for instant fuel economy, fuel level, and coolant temperature. The six-digit odometer shows 205k kilometers (~127k miles), approximately 20k of which have been added under current ownership.",
      "The 2.5-liter M20B25 inline-six was factory rated at 168 horsepower and 164 lb-ft of torque. The water pump, timing belt, and drive belts were replaced in March 2024, and the fuel pump and fuel filter were replaced in July 2024.",
      "Power is sent to all four wheels through a four-speed automatic transmission, an open front differential, and viscous-coupling center and rear differentials. A replacement muffler was fitted in March 2024, and rust is noted behind the right rear wheel opening.",
      "The US Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage. A Carfax Canada report is provided in the gallery and shows the aforementioned collision and theft reports from 1992 through 2006.",
      "The car does not have a title and is being sold on its British Columbia registration, which serves as the ownership document in British Columbia, Canada."

      "This 1973 Toyota Land Cruiser FJ40 was acquired by the current owner in 2020 and subsequently refurbished, with work including disassembling the body, replacing panels, repainting the truck in blue, and re-trimming the cabin in black vinyl. Body-color bedliner material was applied to the underbody, underside of the hood, headliner, and cab floors. The 4.2-liter inline-six was resealed and is fitted with a Weber carburetor, a Downey exhaust header, powder-coated equipment, and replacement ignition components, and it is linked with an overhauled four-speed manual transmission and a dual-range transfer case. Further equipment includes rear jump seats, 15″ wagon wheels, front disc brakes, Rancho shocks, a steering stabilizer, and two cab heaters. This FJ40 was listed on BaT in March 2024 and is now offered again on dealer consignment with a clean Rhode Island title.",
      "The truck was disassembled and stripped before rust repairs were performed and replacement floors, quarter, and tub panels were fitted during the refurbishment. It was subsequently repainted in blue, and the removable hardtop features a white roof. The liftgate mechanism was overhauled and replacement glass, weatherstripping, door hardware, and window regulators were installed.",
      "White 15″ wagon wheels are mounted with 31×10.50″ Toyo Open Country A/T tires, and a matching spare is fitted to the rear swing-away carrier. The truck rides on Rancho shocks and is equipped with manually locking front hubs and an Old Man Emu steering stabilizer.",
      "The front bucket seats and inward-facing rear jump seats were reupholstered in black vinyl during the refurbishment, at which point the front heater assembly was rebuilt and the rear heater received a replacement coil and seals. Body-color bedliner material was applied to the floors, and a roll cage and cargo floor liner are installed.",
      "The instrument cluster was refurbished and features a 100-mph speedometer and gauges for oil pressure, coolant temperature, amperage, and fuel level. The odometer shows 39k miles, and total mileage is unknown.",
      "The 4.2-liter F inline-six is said to be from a 1978 example and is fitted with a Weber 32/36 carburetor and a ceramic-coated Downey exhaust header. The engine is said to have been resealed during the refurbishment, at which point a powder-coated intake manifold, valve cover, and thermostat housing were installed along with a replacement thermostat, alternator, water pump, and ignition components. Fluid services were performed, and the wiring harness is said to have been refurbished.",
      "The frame is said to have been media-blasted before being refinished, and body-color bedliner material was applied to the underbody. The four-speed manual transmission routes power to the rear or all four wheels through a dual-range transfer case, the latter of which is said to have been overhauled along with the differentials. The clutch, pressure plate, flywheel, and release bearings were replaced, according to the selling dealer, and a stainless-steel exhaust system is installed.",
      "Photos showing the truck during various stages of the refurbishment can be seen in the gallery below."

      "This 2001 Ferrari 360 Spider was initially delivered to Ferrari San Francisco in Mill Valley, California, and was acquired by the current owner on BaT in November 2022. The car is powered by a 3.6-liter V8 paired with a six-speed manual transaxle and is finished in Grigio Alloy over Classic Gray leather. Equipment includes a limited-slip differential, a Tubi exhaust system, 18″ two-piece BBS alloy wheels, a black convertible soft top, a Challenge-style rear grille, power-adjustable seats, a gated shifter, a Ferrari-branded stereo, a commemorative dashboard plaque, and automatic climate control. The tires were replaced in May 2019, a timing belt service was performed in May 2020, and the clutch was replaced along with installation of a Tubi exhaust in July 2021. This 360 Spider has 21k miles and is now offered on dealer consignment in Washington State with service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean New Mexico title.",
      "The Pininfarina-designed aluminum body is finished in Grigio Alloy (750) and features xenon headlights, a power-retractable black convertible soft top, a Challenge-style rear grille, and quad exhaust outlets exiting through the rear fascia. The front bumper cover has been refinished, and a crack is noted in the left rear quarter panel along with a scuff underneath the car.",
      "Two-piece 18″ BBS alloy wheels are mounted with Hankook Ventus V12 Evo2 tires that were installed in May 2019. Stopping power is provided by black Ferrari-branded calipers over cross-drilled and ventilated rotors at each corner. The lower ball joints were replaced in July 2021.",
      "The cockpit features power-adjustable seats upholstered in Classic Gray leather along with matching door panel inserts and carpets. Amenities include a gated shifter, a Ferrari-branded stereo, aluminum pedal covers, and automatic climate control. A fire extinguisher has been installed, and sticky buttons have been refinished. The dashboard is equipped with an optional commemorative plaque.",
      "The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a 220-mph speedometer and a tachometer with an 8,500-rpm redline as well as a digital fuel level readout and gauges for oil pressure, oil temperature, and coolant temperature. The digital odometer indicates 21k miles, approximately 500 of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The mid-mounted 3.6-liter Tipo F131 V8 features a flat-plane crankshaft, dry-sump lubrication, dual overhead camshafts, and five valves per cylinder. Factory-rated output was 395 horsepower and 275 lb-ft of torque. Engine belts and idler bearings were replaced and wiring for a battery tender was installed in May 2020. The battery was replaced in 2024.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. A Tubi exhaust system has been installed, and the clutch assembly was replaced in July 2021.",
      "The Carfax report is free of accidents and other reported damage."

Equipment includes a power-operated black soft top, a sport exhaust system, aftermarket 18″ wheels, a speed-activated rear spoiler, a Bose sound system, cruise control, and a JVC stereo with Bluetooth. The car has spent time in multiple states and now has under 88k miles. Acquired by the selling dealer in 2023, this 986 Boxster S is now offered in Georgia at no reserve with the owner’s manual, tools, spare parts, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Virginia title.",

      "This 1965 Chevrolet Chevelle Malibu Sport Coupe was refurbished and modified during previous ownership and fitted with a Z16-specification aluminum 396ci V8 that is linked with a Tremec five-speed manual transmission and a PosiTraction differential. The car was placed on a rotisserie and the bodywork has been refinished in silver during the build, while the cabin was outfitted in red vinyl upholstery with SS-style trim. Additional work included boxing and painting the frame, smoothing the firewall, and installing a Vintage Air climate control system, a retro-look digital stereo, and long-tube headers. Further details include power-assisted steering and four-wheel disc brakes, tubular upper and lower control arms, Hotchkis rear suspension components, 17″ American Racing wheels, and an aluminum radiator with electric fans. This Chevelle Malibu is now offered by the selling dealer with build documentation and a clean Tennessee title.",
      "The car was placed on a rotisserie during the build, and the body was refinished in the Mercedes-Benz shade of Brilliant Silver according to the selling dealer. Replacement glass was installed along with SS and 396 badging, and additional exterior details include a cowl induction hood, polished window trim, and dual side-view mirrors.",
      "American Racing 17″ Torq Thrust-style wheels are mounted with Sumitomo tires. Braking is via power-assisted four-wheel discs and the car is also equipped with power-assisted steering in addition to front and rear sway bars, tubular upper and lower front control arms, and Hotchkis rear suspension components.",
      "The front bucket seats and rear bench were reupholstered in red vinyl during the refurbishment, and they are joined by matching door panels. Appointments include a Vintage Air climate control system, a retro-look digital stereo, SS-style trim, and a Hurst shifter mounted in the center console.",
      "A wood-rimmed two-spoke steering wheel is mounted to a tilting column and frames replacement SS-style instrumentation that includes a 120-mph speedometer, a 7k-rpm tachometer, and a combination display. The five-digit odometer shows 47 miles, which is said to represent the mileage accumulated since the completion of the build. Total mileage is unknown.",
      "The aluminum 396ci V8 is said to have been overhauled and assembled to Z16 specification during the build. The engine is equipped with a solid lifter camshaft, an aluminum radiator, dual electric fans, a Front Runner accessory drive system, and long-tube headers connected to an X-pipe midsection and MagnaFlow mufflers. Billet hood hinges were installed and the firewall was smoothed.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels via a Tremec five-speed manual transmission and a 12-bolt rear end with a PosiTraction differential and a TA cover. The frame was boxed, smoothed, and painted and houses the brake and fuel lines. Additional underbody images are provided in the gallery below.",
      "A binder documenting the refurbishment is included in the sale."

      "This 2010 Chevrolet Corvette ZR1 spent time in Missouri, California, and Massachusetts before it was sold on BaT in July 2021, and it was acquired by the seller on BaT in January 2023. Powered by a supercharged 6.2-liter LS9 V8 paired with a six-speed manual gearbox, the car is finished in Cyber Gray Metallic over black leather and microsuede upholstery. It has been modified with an Akrapovič exhaust system, a Lingenfelter Performance Engineering (LPE) 710 HP engine package kit and engine control unit (ECU) tune, and Caravaggio Corvettes carbon-fiber components including a Modena steering wheel and Daytona Race seats. Additional equipment includes the 3ZR Premium Equipment Group, a limited-slip differential, 19″ and 20″ multi-spoke wheels, Brembo ceramic-composite brakes, xenon headlights, a Bose sound system, navigation, a head-up display, and Keyless Access. This C6 ZR1 indicates 11k miles and is offered with a clean Carfax report and a clean Wisconsin title in the seller’s name.",
      "The C6 ZR1 featured a hydro-formed aluminum chassis paired with composite and carbon-fiber bodywork, and this example is finished in Cyber Gray Metallic. Exterior details include an exposed carbon-fiber roof, xenon headlights, and a clear engine cover. XPEL clear paint protection film was installed on the front bumper, hood, front fenders, and rocker panels in 2017. A previous owner noted a scratch on the left side of the rear spoiler.",
      "Staggered-diameter 19″ and 20″ multi-spoke alloy wheels were mounted with 285/30 front and 335/25 rear Michelin Pilot Super Sport tires in September 2021. Braking is handled by Brembo ceramic-composite discs at each corner, and the car is equipped with Magnetic Ride Control.",
      "A pair of black leather and microsuede-upholstered carbon-fiber Caravaggio Corvettes Daytona Race seats were installed under previous ownership along with a re-wrapped shift knob and parking brake lever. Factory appointments include dual-zone automatic climate control, a head-up display, and Keyless Access with push-button start, while the optional 3ZR Premium Equipment Group added Bose audio, navigation, and a power-telescoping steering column.",
      "The Caravaggio Corvettes Modena steering wheel features carbon fiber along the top of the rim as well as revised thumb grips. Instrumentation includes a 220-mph speedometer, a ZR1-branded tachometer, and gauges for coolant temperature, oil pressure, boost pressure, and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 11k miles, approximately 300 of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The supercharged 6.2-liter LS9 V8 was modified with a Lingenfelter Performance Engineering (LPE) engine control unit (ECU) tune in addition to an LPE 710 HP engine package kit, which included a revised air-intake system, supercharger pulley, cast-aluminum supercharger front cover assembly, 160-degree thermostat, and idler bearing assembly, and drive belt. The accessory and supercharger drive belts were replaced under previous ownership.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a rear-mounted six-speed manual gearbox and a limited-slip differential. An Akrapovič exhaust system with 115mm titanium tips was installed under previous ownership."

      "This 1968 Ford Thunderbird hardtop coupe is finished in yellow over black vinyl and powered by a 429ci “Thunder Jet” V8 paired with a three-speed automatic transmission. Equipment includes hideaway headlights, sequential taillights, power steering, power front disc brakes, 15″ wheels, crank windows, a Philco AM radio, and a dual exhaust system with bullet-style mufflers. The car was acquired by the seller in 2019 and subsequent work consisted of replacing the turn signal relay, battery, and interior lights. This Thunderbird coupe is offered with the manufacturer’s literature, a car cover, a battery tender, spare parts, a historical Wisconsin title, and Rhode Island registration.",
      "The car left the factory finished in yellow and was repainted under prior ownership. Exterior details include pinstriping, a driver-side mirror, sequential taillights, bright side moldings, chrome bumpers, and polished exhaust finishers. The hideaway headlights were reportedly rebuilt under prior ownership.",
      "The steel 15″ wheels wear factory covers and are wrapped in Uniroyal whitewall tires. The car is equipped with power steering and braking is handled by power-assisted front discs and rear drums. The brakes are said to have been serviced approximately five years ago.",
      "The front and rear bench are upholstered in black vinyl joined by a matching dashboard, door panels, and carpets. Woodgrain trim lines the dashboard and steering wheel and interior elements include a left mirror adjuster, crank windows, and a Philco AM radio. The turn signal relay and interior light bulbs were replaced under current ownership. The analog clock does not work.",
      "The two-spoke steering wheel sits ahead of a 120-mph speedometer and gauges for fuel level, oil pressure, alternator charge, and coolant temperature. The five-digit odometer shows 70k miles, approximately 2,500 of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The 429ci “Thunderjet” V8 is fed via a four-barrel carburetor. Work since 2023 is said to consist of replacing the battery and performing an oil change.",
      "Power is delivered to the rear wheels via a three-speed automatic transmission. A dual exhaust system with bullet-style mufflers has been fitted, and the fuel tank is said to have been replaced under prior ownership.",
      "Decoding the data plate reveals the following details:",
      "The car does not have a current title, as it is registered in a state that does not issue titles for vehicles of its age. It is being sold on its Rhode Island registration."

      "Originally finished in Teal Turquoise, the car was repainted white in 2004, at which time the power-operated blue soft top was replaced. Additional details include dual side mirrors, LeMans badging, and dual exhaust outlets. The headlight and taillight bezels were re-chromed under previous ownership, and the trunk floor, body mounts, and soft top motor have been replaced. Rust repair has been performed to the rear wheel wells.",
      "The 14″ wheels are wrapped in 205/70 white-letter BFGoodrich Radial T/A tires that were mounted in 2018, and a full-size spare is mounted in the trunk. Stopping power is provided by power-assisted drum brakes at all four corners. The power steering pump was replaced in 2013, while the shocks and front control arm bushings were replaced in 2015.",
      "The cabin features front bucket seats and a rear bench upholstered in blue cloth with a matching dashboard pad, door panels, and replacement carpets. A push-button AM radio and a locking glovebox are housed in the body-color lower dashboard, and additional equipment includes lap belts for the front occupants, a Hurst shifter, vent windows, and a removable center console. The driver’s door does not open smoothly and the right-rear window requires assistance to roll up.",
      "The wood-rimmed steering wheel features a Pontiac-logo center cap and fronts a 120-mph speedometer and auxiliary gauges. The five-digit odometer shows 49k miles, a few of which were added under current ownership. Total mileage is unknown.",
      "The 350ci V8 was reportedly sourced from a 1969 Pontiac and fitted with a Holley four-barrel carburetor, an Edelbrock intake manifold, and Pontiac-branded valve covers. A replacement heater core was fitted in 2015, while the fuel pump and battery were replaced in 2019.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a four-speed manual transmission. The clutch was replaced and the transmission was overhauled with a replacement 1st gear, bearings, and synchronizers in 2004.",
      "The trim tag decodes as follows:",
      "Pontiac Historic Services documentation, a reproduction window sticker, service records, and an owner’ manual are included in the sale."

    "description": [
      "This 1976 Alfa Romeo Alfetta GT is said to have been sold new in California, and it was registered in Colorado before it was acquired and relocated to California by the seller in 2010. The car is powered by a replacement mechanically fuel-injected 2.0-liter inline-four, and it has been modified with a “Velocissima” body kit, a revised suspension, Recaro front bucket seats, a Momo steering wheel and shifter, and Euro-style bumpers. Finished in yellow over black and grey upholstery, the car is further equipped with a five-speed manual transaxle, 14″ alloy wheels, yellow fog lights, and a Dual CD stereo head unit. This Alfetta is a running project that is now offered with a repair manual, manufacturer’s literature, Alfa Romeo-branded bags, three keys, spare parts, and a clean California title in the seller’s name.",
      "A set of Euro-style bumpers and a “Velocissima” body kit and rear spoiler were installed on the yellow-finished body following the seller’s acquisition. Additional details include yellow fog lights, Alfa Corsa graphics, side mirrors, and twin exhaust outlets. The rear valance was trimmed under previous ownership. There are mounting holes near the door mirrors, bubbling is shown in the center of the hood, and additional photos of paint imperfections are viewable in the gallery below.",
      "Silver-finished 14″ alloy wheels wear Alfa Romeo center caps and are wrapped in Delinte tires. The suspension has been reportedly modified with a Shankle setup. The seller notes that the shock absorbers and suspension bushings would benefit from replacement. A set of Koni shock absorbers and replacement rubber suspension components are included in the sale.",
      "The Recaro front bucket seats are trimmed in black vinyl with gray inserts and are complemented by black door panels and carpets. Interior appointments include a padded dashboard cover, a yellow Momo shift knob, Alfa Romeo-logo floor mats, a Dual CD stereo, a rear roll bar, and a fire extinguisher. Stains are noted on the right-front seat, and the door panels are secured with screws.",
      "The three-spoke Momo steering wheel fronts a tachometer with a 6k-rpm redline. Centrally mounted instrumentation consists of an inoperative 150-mph speedometer as well as gauges for oil pressure, fuel level, and coolant temperature. The five-digit mechanical odometer shows 85k miles, and the total mileage is unknown. A replacement speedometer cable will accompany the car.",
      "The replacement 2.0-liter inline-four features mechanical fuel injection, and it was reportedly overhauled approximately 5k miles ago. The rear fuel pump and the fuel lines are said to have recently been replaced. The seller notes a slow electrical draw, a battery cut-off switch has been installed, and the battery has been replaced in preparation for sale. The car most recently passed a California emissions test in November 2021.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a rear-mounted five-speed manual transaxle. There is a hole in the center resonator, and a replacement center exhaust section is included in the sale.",
      "The car is registered as Planned Non-Operation in the state of California."

      "This 1971 Volkswagen Beetle has been modified in the style of a Baja Bug and was acquired by the seller in 2019. The body has been finished in tan and features fiberglass body panels, tubular bumpers, side rails, a winch, and a receiver hitch, while the interior has been fitted with suspension seats, a bolt-in roll cage, an EMPI trigger shifter, and a CNC Brakes single-lever turning brake system. The car has been fitted with four-wheel disc brakes and the suspension has been modified with boxed rear trailing arms, custom-fabricated chromoly lifted front spindles, and Fox Racing remote-reservoir shocks. Power comes from a replacement single-port air-cooled 1.6L flat-four paired with a Rancho Performance Pro Street four-speed manual transaxle. This Baja Bug is now offered with a clean California title in the seller’s name.",
      "The car has been repainted in tan and is fitted with a Baja-style front valance and fenders as well as tubular bumpers, side rails, and mirror mounts. Additional exterior details consist of off-road lighting, a winch, pop-out rear quarter windows, a receiver hitch, and a rear skid plate.",
      "Aftermarket 15″ wide-five alloy wheels are mounted with General Grabber tires measuring 205/75 up front and 30×9.5″ out back. The suspension has been lifted and features aftermarket boxed rear trailing arms, custom-fabricated chromoly lifted front spindles, and Fox Racing remote-reservoir shocks. The brakes have been converted to disc with two-piston front calipers over drilled rotors up front.  The brakes were bled in preparation for the sale.",
      "Inside, the rear seat has been removed and a bolt-in roll cage has been fitted along with a pair of suspension seats trimmed in black vinyl and cloth upholstery. Sound-deadening material has been applied to the firewall, and additional interior elements include a keyed push-button ignition, lap belts, a wood-rimmed steering wheel, an Optima Red Top battery, an EMPI trigger shifter, and a CNC Brakes single-lever turning brake system. The wiring harness and battery were reportedly replaced under current ownership. The headliner has tears and there is no radio installed, though speakers are mounted in the rear cargo area.",
      "Instrumentation includes a replacement 90-mph speedometer, a Sunpro tachometer, and a VDO fuel level gauge. The five-digit mechanical odometer shows 3k miles, approximately 1k of which have been added under current ownership. True mileage is unknown.",
      "The replacement single-port air-cooled 1.6L flat-four is equipped with Bosch ignition components and an EMPI off-road exhaust system. Work performed in preparation for the sale reportedly included an oil change, valve adjustment, and fan belt replacement.",
      "Power is delivered to the rear wheels through a Rancho Performance Pro Street four-speed manual transaxle equipped with a Super diff and a heavy-duty aluminum side cover. The seller states CB Performance transaxle mounts and Type 2 axles have been installed."

      "This 1931 Buick Series 60 Eight is a Model 67 sedan that was donated to the seller, The National Museum of Transportation in St. Louis, Missouri, in 2022. The car is finished in dark blue over tan cloth upholstery, and power comes from a 273ci straight-eight paired with a three-speed manual transmission. Equipment includes four-wheel mechanical drum brakes, 19″ wood-spoke wheels, front and rear bumpers, cowl lamps, rear-hinged rear doors, a heater, and a rear cabin robe bar and footrest. This Buick Model 8-67 is now offered with a clean Missouri title in the seller’s name.",
      "Buick built a total of 30,665 Model 8-67 sedans for the 1931 model year. This example is finished in dark blue with red pinstriping and features a bright radiator surround and bumpers as well as cowl lamps, cowl vents, running boards, rear-hinged rear doors, and a single taillight. Imperfections in the finish can be seen in the gallery.",
      "Black-painted wood-spoke wheels feature red pinstriping and Buick-branded center caps, and they are mounted with 6.00–19 Lester bias-ply tires. A matching spare rim and tire are stowed out back. The Buick Series 60 Eight rode on a 118″ wheelbase and featured solid axles with front and rear semi-elliptical leaf springs. Stopping power is provided by mechanical drums at all four corners.",
      "The cabin features front and rear benches trimmed in tan tufted cloth along with a color-coordinated headliner, door panels, and rear carpets. A black rubber mat lines the front floors, and additional equipment includes woodgrain dash and window trim, a heater, a rear footrest, and a robe bar mounted on the front seatback.",
      "The four-spoke steering wheel fronts a painted steel dash housing a 90-mph barrel speedometer and gauges for oil pressure, water temperature, fuel level, and amperage. The five-digit odometer shows 45k miles, a few of which were added under the seller’s ownership. Total mileage is unknown.",
      "The 273ci straight-eight features five main bearings and a Marvel carburetor, and it was factory rated at 90 horsepower. The water pump was reportedly serviced in 2024.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels via a three-speed manual transmission.",
      "The car is titled using the reproduction VIN tag shown above."

      "This 2016 Land Rover Range Rover Supercharged was registered in Florida and South Carolina until 2024, and it has 56k miles. Finished in Mariana Black Metallic over Ivory and Ebony leather, it was optioned with 22″ wheels, the Vision Assist Package, which included blind-spot monitoring and a surround camera system, and the Driver Assistance Package, which featured a head-up display and a suite of active parking aids. Heated and ventilated front seats, heated rear seats, InControl touchscreen infotainment, and a Meridian sound system are additional elements. Power comes from a supercharged 5.0-liter V8 linked with an eight-speed automatic transmission. The selling dealer serviced the electronic air suspension and replaced brake components and the tires in preparation for the sale. This Range Rover Supercharged is offered in New York with owner’s manuals, two keys, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Montana title.",
      "The metallic black finish is contrasted by Atlas trim, and the vehicle has LED signature lighting, adaptive xenon headlamps, soft-close doors, power-folding mirrors, and a powered Gesture tailgate.",
      "The 22″ split-spoke wheels are mounted with Continental CrossContact LX Sport tires that show 2023 production date codes. Additional equipment includes selectable Terrain Response 2 driving modes, Adaptive Dynamics continously variable damping, and Dynamic Response hydraulic roll control. The control arms, brake rotors and pads, and front air shocks were replaced in 2024.",
      "The heated and ventilated front seats are trimmed in Ivory Oxford leather, while Ebony leather and Grand Black wood trim accent the cabin, which has a sliding panoramic roof, a Meridian surround sound system, an 8″ touchscreen, configurable mood lighting, solar-attenuating privacy glass, three-zone automatic climate control, and heated rear seats.",
      "The heated steering wheel has paddle shifters and is mounted on a power-adjustable column, and the driver is aided by a heated windshield, a head-up display, a surround camera system, blind-spot monitors, parking sensors, Parallel Parking, Parking Exit, Perpendicular Parking, 360° Park Distance Control, and All Terrain Progress Control, which is an off-road cruise control system for low speeds. The odometer indicates 56k miles.",
      "The supercharged 5.0-liter V8 was factory rated at 510 horsepower and 461 lb-ft of torque, and it sends power to all four wheels through an eight-speed automatic transmission and a dual-range transfer case with an electronic locking center differential. An oil change was completed in preparation for the sale.",
      "Additional photographs of the underside are shown in the gallery below.",
      "The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage."

Now indicating 686 kilometers (~426 miles), the motorcycle is finished in red with silver graphics. Power is provided by a 904cc desmodromic L-twin paired with a six-speed transmission, and equipment includes Marelli electronic fuel injection, a Showa adjustable fork, a Paioli shock, triple disc brakes, and five-spoke 17″ Antera wheels along with a front fairing, a solo seat, clip-on handlebars, side mirrors, and a side stand. This MH900e is offered by the seller on behalf of the owner with a display plaque, a paddock stand, a shipping crate, and a clean Pennsylvania title in the owner’s name.",
      "The MH900e was designed by Pierre Terblanche as an homage to Mike Hailwood’s 1978 Isle of Man TT-winning Ducati 900 SS, and each example left the factory finished in red with silver graphics over a color-coordinated trellis frame. Additional features include a black vinyl-upholstered solo seat, an integrated front fairing, a clear windscreen, dual mirrors, and a side stand.",
      "Five-spoke 17″ Antera wheels wear 120/65 front and 170/60 rear Michelin Pilot Sport tires. Suspension consists of an inverted 43mm Showa fork as well as a Paioli shock attached to the tubular single-sided swingarm. Braking components include dual 320mm rotors with four-piston Brembo calipers up front and a 220mm rotor with a two-piston Brembo caliper at the rear.",
      "Clip-on handlebars are mounted below the upper triple clamp, which fronts a chrome-ringed 10k-rpm tachometer and a digital display that shows menu options and a speedometer. The digital odometer indicates 686 kilometers (~426 miles).",
      "A plate on the fuel tank cover denotes this motorcycle as #1519 of 2,000 MH900evoluzione units produced. An Eric Bostrom signature is visible on the fuel tank cover.",
      "The air-cooled 904cc L-twin features an oil cooler, Marelli fuel injection, a desmodromic valvetrain, and satin black exhaust head pipes with a chrome heat shield. Factory-rated output was 75 horsepower and 56 lb-ft of torque. The battery was changed in July 2024.",
      "Power is routed to the rear wheel through a dry clutch, a six-speed transmission, and a drive chain.",
      "A display plaque will accompany the motorcycle along with a paddock stand, factory literature, and various accessories. Close-up photos of a numbered factory shipping crate can be viewed in the gallery below."

      "This 1972 International Harvester Scout II was repainted dark red under prior ownership, and it is powered by a 345ci V8. Equipment includes a Dana 20 dual-range transfer case, round headlights, a three-slot grille, front vent windows, an aftermarket front bumper, a roll bar, a receiver hitch, power steering, a body lift, manually locking front hubs, front disc brakes, aftermarket wheels, front bucket seats, and a folding rear bench. The truck was acquired by the seller in 2017 and was subsequently fitted with a three-speed automatic 727 transmission, a “steer straight” steering brace, and a replacement tailgate. This Scout II is now offered with service records, spare parts, a car cover, and a clean Ohio title in the seller’s name.",
      "The truck was repainted in a Mercedes-Benz shade of Saturnrot Pearl under prior ownership, and a replacement tailgate was installed and refinished to match the body since the seller’s acquisition. A replacement windshield, mirrors, and aftermarket front bumper were also installed. The seller notes prior metal replacement in the front, rear, and bed. The left side of the hood is bent, there are scratches and dings, and rust on the bedrails is shown in the gallery. Replacement bedrail strips are included in the sale.",
      "The aftermarket black-finished wheels are mounted with 28” Dominator Sport A/T tires. The truck is equipped with manually locking front hubs and power steering, and a body lift has been fitted. Stopping power is provided by front discs and rear drums. The front calipers, rotors, shocks, rear drums, and rear wheel cylinders were reportedly replaced under current ownership, and a “steer straight” steering brace was installed.",
      "The cabin houses front bucket seats and a folding rear bench trimmed in Jet Black vinyl. A textured bedliner material has been applied to the interior, and a GRC roll bar has been added along with shoulder belts, a center console with cupholders, and a Bluetooth speaker. There is a tear on the driver’s seat, the radio is not hooked up, and the heater and air conditioning are inoperative. The seller states that the right window is hard to roll down, the passenger door lock requires a new rubber stopper, and the interior drvier’s door handle is inoperative.",
      "The three-spoke steering wheel fronts a horizontal 120-mph speedometer and gauges for coolant temperature, oil pressure, amperage, and fuel level. A Sunpro tachometer is mounted to the steering column and a three-gauge pod is housed below the dash. The five-digit odometer shows 84k miles, approximately 250 of which were added under current ownership. An aftermarket fuel level gauge was added and the speedometer cable was replaced under current ownership.",
      "The 345ci V8 was factory rated at 197 horsepower and 309 lb-ft of torque. The seller notes the carburetor has been rebuilt, though it requires adjustment. A replacement fuel pump was also installed under current ownership.",
      "A rebuilt three-speed 727 automatic transmission was installed in place of the factory manual gearbox in 2021, and power is routed to the rear or all four wheels through a Dana 20 two-speed transfer case. The U-joints, axles, and driveshafts were reportedly replaced under current ownership. Leaks are noted from the transfer case."

    "description": [
      "This Norton VR880 Sprint Special is one of fewer than 50 examples that were built during the 1990s by Kenny Dreer of Vintage Rebuilds in Clackamas, Oregon. The remanufactured bike is based on a 1974 Commando 850 that was provided by the seller, and it utilizes approximately 80% all-new parts. The motorcycle is powered by a modified 880cc parallel twin equipped with a Mega Cycle camshaft, a Boyer-Bransden electronic ignition system, and dual Keihin flat-slide carburetors, and it is one of fewer than 10 examples that were built with hand-hammered aluminum bodywork by Evan Wilcox. Additional equipment includes a four-speed transmission, a Gates primary belt drive, an electric starter, a modified Roadholder fork, Progressive Suspension shocks, alloy rims, triple disc brakes, a racing-style seat, custom-bent 1.5″ headpipes, and chrome reverse-cone megaphone mufflers. This VR880 Sprint Special was delivered to the seller in September 1999 and is now offered with the original purchase agreement, dynamometer results, service records, a copy of the September 1999 issue of Cycle World magazine in which the model is featured, and a clean South Carolina title in the seller’s name.",
      "Aluminum bodywork hand-formed by Evan Wilcox wears black Norton graphics with red and black stripes and is mounted over a braced and black powder-coasted Isolastic frame. Features include a black racing-style seat with a rear cowl as well as a black-finished front fender, rear-set foot controls, and a center stand.",
      "Wire-spoke wheels measuring 19″ front and 18″ rear are mounted with Avon RoadRider MK II tires. Suspension is handled by a Roadholder fork with modified Honda CBR600F3 cartridges and alloy sliders as well as a pair of preload-adjustable Progressive Suspension shocks mounted to the swingarm. Brakes were sourced from Kosman Engineering out of San Francisco, California, and consist of dual floating drilled rotors with custom hubs and single-piston GMA calipers up front and a single version at the rear. A piston-type damper spans the lower steering stem and the left frame downtube.",
      "A chrome handlebar equipped with bar-end mirrors fronts a 120-mph VDO speedometer, a matching adjustable tachometer with a 6k-rpm redline, and a Lucas ammeter inset atop the chrome headlight bucket. The digital odometer indicates 11k miles. Total mileage is unknown.",
      "The 829cc OHV parallel twin was fitted with with bored cylinders and custom-made 79mm JE Pistons which increased displacement to 880cc. The cylinder heads were ported, the crankshaft was lightened and balanced, and a strengthened re-cast left-side crankcase was utilized. Additional equipment includes dual 35mm Keihin FCR pumper carburetors, Kibblewhite valves, guides, springs, and retainers, a Mega Cycle 6000-series camshaft, alloy connecting rods, a Boyer-Bransden electronic ignition system, a Dyna dual-output coil, and custom-bent 1.5″ headpipes flowing into a pair of upswept reverse-cone megaphone mufflers. The bike was returned to Dreer for the installment of an electric starter, and the starter ring gear was replaced in preparation for the sale.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheel through a Gates primary belt drive, a four-speed transmission with right-side shifting, and a drive chain. The three-piece cush-drive sprocket was sourced from aerospace manufacturer Sertco Industries of Okemah, Oklahoma."

The five-digit odometer shows 70k miles, approximately 50 of which were added under current ownership. The coolant temperature gauge was repaired in preparation for the sale.",

Powered by a 3.2-liter inline-six linked with a six-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential, the car is also equipped with manually adjustable Vader front sport seats, dual-zone automatic climate control, and an aftermarket Pioneer stereo head unit.

      "This 1985 Land Rover 90 is a left-hand-drive example that was fitted with a Cummins R2.8 turbodiesel inline-four and a replacement five-speed manual transmission and dual-range transfer case under previous ownership. Finished in gray over black leather, it is equipped with an Alisport intercooler and radiator as well as a Spectre air intake, 16″ steel wheels, Fox front shocks, Bilstein rear shocks, Old Man Emu springs, and LED headlights. Other features include inward-facing jump seats, an Alpine head unit, aftermarket speakers, and air conditioning. The truck was imported to the US under previous ownership and was acquired by the seller on BaT in February 2023. This Land Rover 90 is offered with a Carfax report and a clean Georgia title in the seller’s name.",
      "The truck is said to have been repaired and repainted in its current shade of gray under previous ownership. Exterior features include LED headlights, black fender flares, sliding rear windows, and windshield vents. Checker-plate trim was installed under current ownership.",
      "Black-finished 16″ steel wheels wear 255/85 Bighorn Maxxis tires, and a matching spare is secured to the rear. The truck rides on a lifted suspension with Old Man Emu coil springs and Fox shocks up front and Bilstein shocks out back. Stopping power is provided by front discs and rear drums. 30mm wheel spacers are installed.",
      "The cabin features front bucket seats and inward-facing jump seats that have been reupholstered in black Exmoor Trim leather. Work under previous ownership included installing a custom-fabricated rear bulkhead delete bar, applying Dynamat sound deadening material to the cab floor, and modifying the lower dash to accommodate a Ministry of Defender heating and air conditioning system. A Focal amplifier, BLAM speakers, JL Audio subwoofers, and an Alpine head unit with Apple CarPlay were added under current ownership along with carpet and a rubber mat in the cargo area.",
      "Instrumentation includes a 120-mph speedometer, auxiliary gauges, and a Murphy digital display. The six digit-mechanical odometer shows 19k miles, approximately 5k of which were added under current ownership. Total mileage is unknown. The coolant temperature gauge does not work.",
      "The Cummins R2.8 turbodiesel inline-four crate engine was installed under previous ownership along with a replacement R380 five-speed manual transmission and LT230 dual-range transfer case. The engine has been fitted with a Spectre air intake as well as an Alisport intercooler and radiator with an electric puller fan. A Tom Wood’s custom rear driveshaft and a Britpart exhaust system are installed. The fuse box was upgraded under current ownership according to the seller, and an oil change was performed in June 2024.",
      "Additional underside photos are provided in the gallery below.",
      "The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage."

It remained registered to its original owner until 2024 and was later acquired by the selling dealer. The vehicle has a Bilstein active-damping suspension, 20″ alloy wheels, Brembo disc brakes, a panoramic sunroof, heated and ventilated front seats, a heated second-row bench, a Harman Kardon sound system, and a suite of electronic driving aids. This Grand Cherokee SRT has 5k miles and is offered with a clean Carfax report and a clean New Jersey title.",
      "SRT Night vehicles feature gloss-black trim, and this one is finished in Brilliant Black Crystal Pearl. Exterior equipment includes a panoramic sunroof, a power-operated tailgate, a receiver hitch, bi-xenon headlights, LED taillights, parking sensors, and dual exhaust outlets. Photos of paint meter readings are provided in the image gallery below.",
      "Black Satin-finished 20″ alloy wheels are wrapped in 295/45 Pirelli Scorpion Verde All Season tires. The SRT rides on a Bilstein active-damping suspension and braking is handled by gloss red Brembo calipers over a ventilated disc at each corner. There are scuffs on the wheels.",
      "The heated and ventilated front seats and heated split-folding rear bench are upholstered in black Laguna leather with SRT logos debossed in the front backrests. Carbon-fiber trim accents the dashboard and door panels, and additional appointments include remote start, keyless Enter-N-Go, push-button ignition, dual-zone automatic climate control, a rearview camera, navigation, and an 8.4″ Uconnect infotainment system linked to a 19-speaker Harman Kardon sound system.",
      "The heated steering wheel features paddle shifters and is mounted on a power tilting and telescoping column. Instrumentation consists of a central digital tachometer with a 6k-rpm redline flanked by a 180-mph speedometer and gauges for coolant temperature and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 5k miles. Adaptive cruise control and blind-spot and cross-path detection were standard equipment.",
      "The 6.4-liter Hemi V8 was factory rated at 475 horsepower and 470 lb-ft of torque. The fuel injection system was flushed in April 2021.",
      "Power is delivered to all four wheels via an eight-speed automatic transmission, a Quadra-Trac active on-demand four-wheel-drive system, and an electronic limited-slip rear differential.",

      "This 1990 Freightliner Unimog FLU419 is a former US military vehicle that is said to have been previously owned by a fire department before being purchased by the seller in 2023. The truck is finished in red and has been fitted with a rear cargo bed featuring bedside storage lockers. The cab houses bucket seats trimmed in black vinyl, and power comes from a 5.7-liter Mercedes-Benz diesel inline-six mated to a manual gearbox and a dual-range transfer case. Further equipment includes portal axles, locking differentials, 20″ steel wheels, four-wheel disc brakes, and power-assisted steering along with an air intake snorkel, a front brush guard, a receiver hitch, and a rear bumper with a retractable step. Previously listed on BaT in April 2024, this Freightliner Unimog is now offered with a US Army service manual and a clean Georgia title in the seller’s name listing the truck as a 1990 Freightliner FLA086.",
      "The Unimog 419 was classified as a Small Emplacement Excavator and was used by the US Army as an engineering vehicle. This example was repainted in red under previous ownership and features a rear cargo bed with bedside storage lockers. The front bumper incorporates a brush guard along with a roller fairlead for a winch, while the rear bumper features a pull-out step and is accompanied by a receiver hitch. Further details include an air intake snorkel, vent windows, and side steps.",
      "The 20″ six-lug steel wheels are finished in black and wear Mercedes-Benz center caps. They are mounted with 335/80 Continental MPT 81 tires, and a spare is stored in the bed. The truck is equipped with power-assisted steering, and braking is handled by discs at all four corners.",
      "The cab is equipped with low-back bucket seats trimmed in black vinyl upholstery along with a color-matched engine cover and door panels. Controls for the gearbox and transfer case are located between the seats.",
      "A two-spoke steering wheel frames a 65-mph VDO speedometer and auxiliary gauges, and a Ricker Instrument Company inclinometer is fitted atop the instrument panel. The six-digit odometer shows 2,200 miles, while an engine hour meter mounted in the engine bay shows 914 hours of runtime. Total mileage is unknown. The tachometer does not work.",
      "The 5.7-liter Mercedes-Benz OM352 diesel inline-six was factory rated at 110 horsepower. It is linked to a four-speed manual gearbox with a high/low range and a splitter, offering sixteen forward gears and eight reverse gears.",
      "Power is sent to all four wheels through a dual-range transfer case, locking differentials, and portal axles. Corrosion beneath the battery box can be seen in the gallery.",
      "The chassis plate shown above lists a February 1990 build date."

      "This 1985 Toyota Land Cruiser HJ47 pickup is said to have spent time in Costa Rica before being imported to the US in 2021 and later refurbished by Elite Land Cruisers of Buckhead, Georgia. The truck is finished in green over beige vinyl upholstery and is powered by a 4.0-liter diesel inline-six linked with a four-speed manual transmission and a dual-range transfer case. Equipment includes a headache rack, 15″ steel wheels, manually locking front hubs, Vintage Air climate control, and brown vinyl floor liners. Acquired by the current owner in 2022, this HJ47 is offered on dealer consignment in Wisconsin with a clean Florida title.",
      "The truck is finished in green with a white roof and is equipped with a steel front bumper, a headache rack, a drop-down tailgate, and fender-mounted indicators.",
      "This is a relist after the vehicle was previously sold on BaT in June 2024 and the winning bidder failed to follow through with their commitment to purchase. This was not due to any fault with the vehicle. The winner’s participation on BaT has been restricted.",
      "The 15″ steel wheels are wrapped in 33×10.50″ BFGoodrich All-Terrain T/A KO2 tires. The front axle is equipped with Warn manually locking hubs, and braking is handled by four-wheel drums.",
      "The split bench seat is trimmed in beige vinyl that extends to the dashboard and door panels. Brown vinyl liners protect the footwells, and Vintage Air climate control is said to have been added.",
      "The three-spoke steering wheel frames a 160-km/h speedometer as well as gauges for oil pressure, fuel level, coolant temperature, and amperage. The five-digit odometer shows 2,500 kilometers (~1,500 miles), approximately 2k of which were added under current ownership. Total mileage is unknown.",
      "The 4.0-liter 2H diesel inline-six is said to have been rebuilt as part of the refurbishment, which also included replacing the wiring harness according to the seller. An oil change was performed in preparation for the sale.",
      "Power is routed to the rear or all four wheels through a four-speed manual transmission and a dual-range transfer case. The selling dealer notes that the frame was powder-coated and the driveline was rebuilt during the refurbishment. A Rush Racing exhaust is installed."

      "This 2008 Tesla Roadster is #48 of the first 100 produced, which were sold as the Signature 100 Edition. This car was the recipient of nearly $26k in service by Gruber Motor Company of Phoenix, Arizona, in February 2024, the process of which included a “Level 2” battery pull, a “Level 2 Full Rebuild” on the PEM, rebuilding the switchpack, reupholstering the seats and door panels, converting the headlights to LEDs, and replacing the battery coolant pumps. The car features a 1.5-series battery pack powering a three-phase AC induction motor paired with a single-speed transmission, and it is finished in Twilight Blue over black leather. Equipment includes a removable roof panel, a black removable soft top, 16″ and 17″ forged aluminum wheels, and heated sport seats. The car has spent time in California and Pennsylvania and now has 52k miles. Recently acquired by the selling dealer, this Roadster is now offered in New York with service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Pennsylvania title.",
      "The Tesla Roadster was based on the aluminum tub from the contemporary Lotus Elise, with which it shared its windshield and windshield frame. The remainder of the carbon-fiber body panels were unique to the Tesla, and it utilized a 2″ longer wheelbase than the Elise. This example is finished in Twilight Blue and features a removable roof panel, a black removable soft top, an exterior charging port, an integrated rear spoiler, and LED taillights. The front bumper cover was replaced in July 2011, and work in February 2024 included removing clear paint protection film, performing paint correction, and rebuilding the headlights and converting them to LEDs. Scrapes and peeling clearcoat are visible on the front bumper cover.",

The car is equipped with traction control as well as front and rear independent wishbone suspension with co-axial coil springs and telescopic dampers. Stopping power is provided by four-wheel discs with a regenerative braking system. The rear brake pads were replaced in February 2024.",
      "The heated sport seats and door panel inserts were reupholstered in black leather in February 2024 by Gruber Motor Company. Appointments include a JVC stereo, cruise control, and air conditioning. Records indicate that the switchpack was rebuilt in February 2024.",
      "A plaque between the headrests identifies this example as #48 of the first 100 Tesla Roadster models produced.",
      "The three-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel fronts a 150-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 13k-rpm redline. A configurable multifunction LCD screen is mounted to the left of the steering column. The digital odometer indicates 52k miles.",
      "A 53-kilowatt-hour battery pack powers a three-phase, 375-volt AC induction motor featuring a hand-wound stator. Factory-rated output was 248 horsepower and 200 lb-ft of torque. Power is delivered to the rear wheels through a single-speed transmission. Work in February 2024 included a “Level 2” battery pull, a “Level 2 Full Rebuild” on the power electronics module (PEM), and replacing the battery coolant pumps.",

      "This 1973 Toyota Land Cruiser FJ40 was acquired by the seller in 2010 and was subsequently modified and refurbished. It was fitted with a 6.0-liter LQ9 Vortec V8 and an H55F five-speed manual transmission, the dual-range transfer case was rebuilt, and an Auburn limited-slip rear differential was installed. The truck was repainted green, and the interior was refreshed with replacement seats, a Vintage Air climate control system, Dakota Digital gauges, a Grant steering wheel, a Tuffy center console, power windows, and a Metal Tech 4×4 roll cage. Riding on a lifted suspension with Fox shocks and Old Man Emu springs over 17″ aftermarket wheels and four-wheel disc brakes, the truck is also equipped with aftermarket bumpers, an air-intake snorkel, a Rigid Industries light bar, and a Warn winch. This FJ40 is offered with service records and a clean New York title in the seller’s name.",
      "During the refurbishment, a hardtop, windshield frame, and doors from a 1980 FJ40 were fitted, the bumpers, side mirrors, headlights, windshield, and side windows were replaced, and the truck was repainted green. Additional equipment includes a Rigid Industries light bar, LED headlights, an air-intake snorkel, and a Warn winch.",
      "The 17″ black-finished aftermarket wheels are mounted with BFGoodrich All-Terrain T/A KO2 tires. The truck is equipped with a 4″ suspension lift, Fox shocks, Old Man Emu springs, manually locking front hubs, and four-wheel disc brakes. Additional work during the refurbishment included rebuilding the front brake calipers, performing a power steering conversion, and replacing the body mounts and suspension bushings.",
      "The front bucket seats and rear bench are trimmed in black upholstery and were installed under current ownership, at which time the dash pad and carpets were also replaced. Appointments include Vintage Air climate control, a Sony CD stereo, Rockford Fosgate speakers, power windows, a Tuffy center console, and a Metal Tech 4×4 roll cage.",
      "The Grant steering wheel is mounted to a tilting column and frames Dakota Digital instrumentation including a 120-mph speedometer and supplementary gauges. The digital odometer shows 1,800 miles. Total mileage is unknown.",
      "The 6.0-liter LQ9 Vortec V8 is said to have been sourced from a 2003 Cadillac Escalade. The following components were also replaced during the refurbishment:",
      "During the build, the H55F five-speed manual transmission was installed, the dual-range transfer case was rebuilt, the Auburn limited-slip rear differential was fitted, a Nitro rear differential cover and 4.11:1 Yukon gears were installed, the driveshaft U-joints were replaced, and the frame was refinished."

      "This 2023 Porsche 911 GT3 RS was specified from the factory with the Tribute to Carrera RS Package featuring Python Green 20″ and 21″ magnesium wheels and exterior graphics along with unique interior elements and a suite of accessories. It was ordered new by the current owner through Porsche Hunt Valley in Cockeysville, Maryland, and now has 1,200 miles. Power is supplied by a 4.0-liter flat-six that drives the rear wheels through a seven-speed PDK dual-clutch transaxle and an electronically locking differential, while the Weissach Package reduces weight by utilizing a carbon-composite roof panel, front lid, anti-roll bars, and interior trim. The car is further equipped with a front axle lift system and carbon-ceramic brakes along with LED-Matrix Design headlights, Exclusive Design taillights, carbon-fiber bucket seats, and a Bose surround sound system. This Tribute to Carrera RS 992 GT3 RS is now offered in Maryland by the seller on behalf of the owner with a window sticker, manufacturer’s literature, accessories, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Montana title.",
      "The Tribute to Carrera RS Package was released for the US market in 2023 as an homage to the 1973 911 Carrera RS 2.7 that debuted 50 years prior. The package specified white paint accented by Python Green mirror caps, GT3 RS side graphics, model badging, and rear wing accents along with CFRP panels finished in exposed carbon-fiber weave from the Weissach Package.",
      "As in the standard GT3 RS, the car features lightweight glass, vented front fenders, and a carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) front trunk lid, roof panel, and rear swan-neck-hinged wing with drag-reduction (DRS) functionality. It is further equipped with LED-Matrix Design headlights with PDLS+, Exclusive Design taillights, a rear fog light, and rear ParkAssist. Paint protection film was applied to the hood, front bumper, fenders, doors, mirrors, and rear wing in 2023.",
      "The forged lightweight magnesium 20″ and 21″ GT3 center-lock wheels are finished in Python Green and mounted with Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires measuring 275/35 up front and 335/30 out back. Stopping power is provided by Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes (PCCB) with gloss black–finished calipers over cross-drilled and ventilated discs at each corner. The car is equipped with a front-axle lift system, rear-axle steering, and the Weissach Package, which added carbon-fiber front and rear anti-roll bars and coupling rods.",
      "The carbon-fiber bucket seats are trimmed in black leather with Race-Tex inserts, “Weissach RS” embroidery on the headrests, and Tribute to Carrera RS tailoring with Python Green stitching that extends to the dash, center console, knee pads, and door panels. Carbon-fiber trim accents the cabin as well as the illuminated door sill guards, while the carpets are protected by Porsche-branded floor mats with leather edging and deviated stitching. Further appointments include Porsche Communication Management infotainment with navigation in addition to a Bose surround-sound system, dual-zone automatic climate control, cruise control, an ambient lighting system, and auto-dimming mirrors.",
      "The GT3 sports steering wheel features a vehicle configuration dial and frames a central tachometer with a 9k-rpm redline as well as a digital speed readout and configurable TFT screens. The digital odometer indicates 1,200 miles. The shift paddles were replaced in April 2024.",
      "An Andreas Preuninger signature appears in the front trunk.",
      "The 4.0-liter flat-six features direct fuel injection, VarioCam variable valve timing, dry-sump lubrication, and individual throttle bodies. It was rated at 518 horsepower and 342 lb-ft of torque. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a seven-speed PDK dual-clutch transaxle and an electronically locking differential. A stainless-steel sport exhaust system was fitted as standard, and the car was optioned with an extended range fuel tank. The oil was changed in preparation for the sale.",
      "The window sticker shows initial delivery to Porsche Hunt Valley and lists factory colors, equipment, and a total price of $339,190.",
      "Each 2023 Porsche 911 GT3 RS ordered with the Tribute to Carrera RS Package was accompanied by a collection of accessories including:",

      "This 2019 Porsche 911 Speedster is #1,716 of 1,948 examples produced for the model year and was purchased new by the current owner at Porsche Redwood City in California. Having 12 miles, it is powered by a 4.0-liter flat-six paired with a six-speed manual transaxle and is finished in GT Silver Metallic. The car was optioned with 20″ GT3 center-lock alloy wheels, carbon-ceramic brakes, a limited-slip differential, a front-axle lift system, a black soft top, and a carbon-fiber twin-hump convertible-top cover panel. The cockpit features the Chrono and Light Design Packages, extended black leather with red deviated stitching, carbon-fiber trim, a Bose surround sound system, and carbon-fiber full bucket seats. This 911 Speedster is now offered by the seller on behalf of the owner with a window sticker, the owner’s manual, an accident-free Carfax report, and a clean California title in the current owner’s name.",
      "The Speedster shares styling cues with the 991 GT3 including a similar front splitter and bumper covers, while features unique to the Speedster consist of a shorter windshield, a manually retractable black soft top, and a body-color carbon-fiber twin-hump convertible-top cover panel. This example is finished in GT Silver Metallic and has xenon headlights, a speed-activated rear spoiler, body-color side skirts, carbon-fiber mirror caps, and dual exhaust outlets.",
      "Center-locking 20″ forged alloy wheels are mounted with staggered-width Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires. Braking is handled by four-wheel cross-drilled Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes with yellow Porsche-branded calipers. Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM), Porsche Stability Management (PSM), and rear-axle steering were standard on the Speedster, and this example was optioned with a front-axle lift system.",
      "The interior was optioned with black leather extending from the carbon-fiber full bucket seats to the dashboard, center console, steering column, door panel inserts, inner door sill guards, sun visors, and air vent surrounds, with red deviated stitching throughout. Carbon-fiber trim adorns the cabin, and additional amenities include the Light Design Package, illuminated carbon-fiber door sill guards, Porsche Communication Management with navigation, dual-zone automatic climate control, a Bose surround sound system, aluminum pedals, a fire extinguisher, cruise control, “Speedster” headrest embroidery, and a Porsche crest on the center armrest.",
      "A serialized plaque located between the seats denotes this example as #1,716 of 1,948 Speedsters produced.",
      "The three-spoke leather-wrapped GT sports steering wheel features a red centering stripe and deviated stitching. Instrumentation consists of a central tachometer with a 9k-rpm redline flanked by a 225-mph speedometer and gauges for oil temperature, oil pressure, coolant temperature, and fuel level. The Chrono Package added a stopwatch atop the dashboard. The digital odometer indicates 12 miles.",
      "The naturally aspirated, GT3-sourced 4.0L flat-six features VarioCam Plus valve timing and was updated for the Speedster with revised individual throttle bodies and high-pressure fuel injectors. Factory rated power output was 502 horsepower and 346 lb-ft of torque.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels via a six-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. The car is equipped with an optional 23.7-gallon extended-range fuel tank. Additional photos of the underside are provided in the gallery.",
      "The window sticker shows initial delivery to Porsche Redwood City in California, along with factory colors, options, and a total price of $301,440. The owner’s manual, a binder documenting the car, and two painted-to-match keys with a leather key pouch are also included in the sale.",
      "The Carfax report lists at least one open recall.",
      "The California title carries a “title only” notation.",
      "The car is registered as Planned Non-Operation in the state of California."

      "This 1971 Mercedes-Benz 280SL underwent a refurbishment under previous ownership in California circa 2019, and it sold on BaT in November 2022. Work under previous ownership included rebuilding the 2.8-liter inline-six, installing a six-speed S&SG manual transmission, replacing the tan soft top, refreshing the tan interior, and servicing the braking and fueling systems. The car is finished in green, and additional equipment includes a body-color hardtop, 14″ steel wheels with covers, VDO gauges, an AM/FM radio, Coco floor mats, and PerTronix electronic ignition. Acquired by the current owner in 2022, this W113 SL is offered in California on dealer consignment with the owner’s manual, a tool roll, and a Montana title.",
      "The car was refinished in green under previous ownership and is equipped with a removable body-color hardtop in addition to a replacement tan soft top that was installed in 2019. The left front fender is said to have been repaired and the inboard front fender tips are noted to be missing. The forward portions of the car show signs of bodywork, and paint chips and evidence of surface preparation in the finish are present on various body panels. The rear floor pan was refinished in 2019, and dents on the left quarter panel and trunk lid were repaired that same year.",
      "Black 14″ steel wheels wear polished covers with body-color centers, and they were mounted with Vredestein Sprint Classic tires in 2019. Bilstein front shocks were also installed at that time. Braking is provided by power-assisted four-wheel discs.",
      "Interior work under previous ownership included reupholstering the bucket seats in tan, adjusting the door and door windows, servicing the driver’s window regulator, and replacing the air conditioning compressor. Appointments include tan carpeting covered by Jaspe Coco mats as well as an analog clock and a push-button AM/FM radio.",
      "A two-spoke steering wheel sits ahead of VDO instrumentation that includes a 140-mph speedometer, a 7k-rpm tachometer, and vertical auxiliary gauges. The five-digit odometer shows 69k miles, and the clock and speedometer were serviced in 2019 by Palo Alto Speedometer in California. Total mileage is unknown.",
      "The fuel-injected 2.8L inline-six was rebuilt in 2020, and work included hot tanking the block in addition to boring and honing the cylinders. The cylinder head was overhauled with replacement valves and guides, and the engine block and cylinder head were resurfaced before being reassembled. A PerTronix electronic ignition is installed.",
      "The factory four-speed automatic transmission was replaced with a six-speed S&SG manual transmission in 2020. The flywheel, clutch components, and pedals were replaced as part of the transmission replacement. Rust perforation is noted on the front crossmember.",
      "A previously issued California title lists an odometer brand of “exceeds mechanical limits.”"

Equipment includes a limited-slip differential, 16″ five-spoke alloy wheels, pop-up headlights, air conditioning, power windows, a cassette stereo, and a gated shifter. This Testarossa is offered on dealer consignment with service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean California title.",

      "Silver 16″ five-spoke alloy wheels are mounted with BFGoodrich g-Force Sport tires. Braking is handled by four-wheel ventilated discs.",
      "The cockpit is trimmed in Nero Connolly leather upholstery over the seats, door panels, and lower dashboard. Interior amenities include a Kenwood cassette stereo, motorized seat belts, and a gated shifter located on the center console alongside controls for the air conditioning, rear window defroster, and power windows.",
      "The three-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel frames Veglia instrumentation including a 200-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 6,800-rpm redline as well as gauges for oil pressure and coolant temperature. A clock and auxiliary gauges for fuel level and oil temperature are housed in the center stack. The six-digit odometer shows 22k miles, approximately 11k of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The 4.9-liter flat-12 was factory rated at 380 horsepower and 354 lb-ft of torque. A timing belt service is said to have been completed in 2015 at approximately 2k miles ago.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a five-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential.",
      "The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage. An entry in April 2015 states that the car was designated a gross polluter in California, although the car has since passed California emissions inspections."

Paint chips, faded paint, and dents around the exterior are shown up close in photos provided below.",

The seller notes the front brakes occasionally make noise.",
      "The cabin features two seats upholstered in black leather with red piping, and interior appointments include safety harnesses, a padded dashboard, a heater, and a carpeted rear parcel shelf.",
      "The four-spoke steering wheel frames Smiths instrumentation including a 140-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 5,500-rpm redline as well as gauges for coolant temperature, oil pressure, and fuel level. The five-digit odometer shows 32k miles, approximately 28k of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The 2.9-liter inline-six was factory equipped with dual SU carburetors and an oil cooler, and an aftermarket electronic distributor has been fitted. Factory-rated output was 145 horsepower and 174 lb-ft of torque. Replacement engine gaskets were installed and the engine was repainted in 2018.",
      "Power is routed to the rear wheels through a four-speed manual transmission with overdrive. The fuel system was reportedly refurbished in 2015, and the clutch components were replaced in 2018.",
      "The attached identification plate seen above shows the car number. The VIN on the Wisconsin title lists the letter “I” as the fourth character instead of the number “1”."

      "This 1964 Austin-Healey 3000 BJ7 Mk II is a 2+2 convertible that was acquired by the seller in 1965 in Pittsburgh. The car is powered by a 2.9-liter inline-six that was rebuilt approximately 25 years ago and which is linked to a four-speed manual transmission with overdrive. Following the rebuild the car was placed in long-term storage, and the car disassembled and refurbished between August 2017 and October 2018. Finished in green over tan leather upholstery, it has chrome-plated bumpers with overriders as well as 15″ wire wheels, front disc brakes, stainless-steel exhaust components, a tan soft top, a hood scoop, dual side mirrors, a Smiths heater, and a Pioneer stereo. This 3000 BJ7 is now offered at no reserve with a front-end cover and a clean Ohio title in the seller’s name.",
      "The seller reports that the car was fully disassembled during the refurbishment before it was repainted in the current shade of green. Exterior details include a tan convertible soft top, a hood scoop, dual fender-mounted side mirrors, red 3000 Mk II badging, dual polished exhaust outlets, and chrome bumpers with overriders. The radio antenna is disconnected and a black front-end cover is included in the sale. The antenna is broken.",
      "Silver-finished 15” wire wheels secured by two-eared knock-offs are mounted with 165-series Monarch radial tires that were mounted approximately 20 years ago. A spare wheel with a mismatched tire is located in the trunk, and braking is provided by front discs and rear drums.",
      "The 2+2 seating was re-trimmed in tan leather while dark tan upholstery accents the dashboard and door panels. Appointments include a Smiths heater, a dash-mounted rearview mirror, an aftermarket Pioneer stereo, front lap belts, and a passenger grab handle. Portions of the seat upholstery is loose and shows creasing.",
      "The banjo-style steering wheel sits ahead of Smiths instrumentation that includes a 120-mph speedometer, a 6k-rpm tachometer, and gauges for oil pressure, coolant temperature, and fuel level. The five-digit odometer shows 79k miles, approximately 70k of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The 2.9-liter inline-six was rebuilt between 1997 and 2000 according to the seller, who notes the dual SU carburetors were installed at that time and PerTronix electronic ignition was added. Approximately 50 miles have been added since the rebuild. The car is difficult to start when cold, and the removed carburetors are included in the sale.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a four-speed manual transmission with an electrically actuated overdrive unit. A dual stainless-steel exhaust system has been installed. A rattle is audible in the exhaust video in the gallery below."

      "This 1985 BMW M635CSi is a black-on-black European-market example that was imported to the US in June 1985 and remained with its original owner in California until the current owner acquired the car on BaT in July 2021. Power is provided by a 3.5-liter M88/3 inline-six mated to a five-speed manual transmission, and the car is equipped with a limited-slip differential, 17″ BBS wheels, a power sunroof, front and rear spoilers, air conditioning, power-adjustable front seats, and an Alpine CD stereo. This E24 M635CSi shows 168k miles and is now offered by the seller on behalf of the current owner with manufacturer’s literature, period brochures, import documents, service records dating to 1984, a tool kit, an accident-free Carfax report, and a clean California title in the owner’s name.",
      "The car is finished in black (086) with white pinstripes and features a power-operated sunroof, fog lights, bright trim, both front and decklid spoilers, and twin center-exit exhaust outlets. Photos provided in the gallery show cracked fog and marker light lenses as well as dents below the right-rear window and blemishes around the front of the car. The silver trim on the front spoiler was refinished in preparation for the sale.",
      "Multi-piece 17″ BBS wheels are mounted with 235/45 Pirelli P-Zero tires. The M635CSi was factory-equipped with a lowered sport suspension and a 26-mm front sway bar, and aftermarket rear shocks have been installed. Anti-lock braking is provided by power-assisted four-wheel discs. The sway bar bushings were replaced in January 2024, and the seller notes the brake pads were replaced in preparation for the sale.",
      "The power-adjustable front comfort seats have been reupholstered in black leather, and they are joined by color-coordinated door panels and carpeting. An Alpine CD stereo has been installed, and amenities include air conditioning, power-operated windows and locks, an onboard computer, and an M-branded leather-wrapped shift knob. The steering wheel and dashboard were reconditioned under current ownership. The clock is inoperative.",
      "The M-Tech 1 steering wheel frames a tachometer with a 6,500-rpm redline as well as a 160-mph speedometer and gauges for fuel level and coolant temperature. The six-digit odometer shows 168k miles, approximately 4k of which were added under current ownership. The instrument cluster was removed and reinstalled to facilitate the replacement of the light bulbs in September 2022.",
      "The 3.5-liter DOHC M88/3 inline-six is equipped with individual throttle bodies and differs from the US-market S38B35 by featuring a single-row timing chain, exhaust headers, and a piston and head combination that results in a higher 10.5:1 compression ratio. Factory-rated output was 282 horsepower and 252 lb-ft of torque. A fuel hose was replaced in April 2022, and work in March 2024 involved replacing the ignition cap and rotor along with the spark plugs.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a five-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential. The transmission fluid was changed in April 2022.",
      "Documents related to the car’s import can be viewed in the gallery and are included in the sale. Manufacturer’s literature, period brochures, and service records dating to 1984 will also accompany the car.",
      "The Carfax report is free of accidents or other damage and lists history in California beginning in 1986.",
      "The car has been designated a gross polluter by the state of California, however, the car since passed a California emissions test in March 2024."

      "This Chevy Junior go-kart was manufactured by Rupp Industries of Mansfield, Ohio, and is based on the design of the 1965 Chevrolet Monza SS show car. It features white fiberglass bodywork mounted over a tubular steel frame, and it is powered by a 3.5 horsepower Tecumseh single-cylinder engine fitted at the rear and linked with a centrifugal clutch and a drive chain. Features include 5″ Rupp turbine wheels, a single seat trimmed in black vinyl, and a three-spoke steering wheel. This Rupp Monza Junior was acquired by the seller roughly 14 years ago, and it is now offered by the selling dealer at no reserve in Gainesville, Georgia, on a bill of sale.",
      "The original Monza kart design was custom-built at the GM Tech Center for Bill Mitchell’s stepson and Chuck Jordan’s son. Their popularity inspired General Motors to contract Rupp to produce a run of karts for commercial sale based on an existing Rupp chassis. Rupp later marketed the kart as both the Monza Junior and Chevy Junior. This example has been finished in white, and additional features include a “Chevy Junior” plate, Chevrolet scripts, and faux taillights with red quad reflectors.",
      "The 5″ Rupp turbine wheels feature polished lips and are mounted with Goodyear tires. Stopping power is provided by a single mechanically operated rear drum.",
      "The cockpit features a black vinyl seat, a three-spoke steering wheel with polished accents, and a simulated instrument cluster.",
      "The pull-start Tecumseh single was factory rated at 3.5 horsepower, which is routed to the rear wheels through a centrifugal clutch and a drive chain.",
      "The manufacturer’s plaque is affixed to the body and shows serial number 29516."

      "This 1997 Porsche Boxster has 43k miles following an IMS bearing and clutch replacement in September 2021. It is powered by a 2.5-liter flat-six paired with a five-speed manual transaxle and is finished in Arctic Silver Metallic over black leather. Features include a black soft top, 16″ alloy wheels, a speed-activated rear spoiler, a Becker Porsche CR-210 cassette stereo, a Sony CD changer, cruise control, and automatic climate control. This 986 Boxster is now offered by the selling dealer at no reserve with the owner’s manual, service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Minnesota title.",
      "The car is finished in Arctic Silver Metallic and features a black soft top, and additional features include a speed-activated rear spoiler, side air intakes, and roll hoops.",
      "The 16″ alloy wheels are mounted with Bridgestone Potenza S02A S-04 Pole Position tires. Braking is handled by four-piston Porsche-branded calipers fitted over vented rotors at all four corners.",
      "The cabin features seats upholstered in black leather, while Porsche-branded floor mats line the footwells. Additional features include a Becker Porsche CR-210 cassette stereo, a remote Sony CD changer, cruise control, and automatic climate control. A satellite radio receiver has been installed in lower portion of the center console.",
      "The leather-wrapped steering wheel fronts a central tachometer, a 160-mph speedometer, and gauges for coolant temperature and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 43k miles.",
      "The mid-mounted 2.5-liter M96 flat-six was factory rated at 201 horsepower and 181 lb-ft of torque. The IMS bearing was replaced in September 2021, and additional work at that time included replacing the rear crankshaft seal, the water pump, and the spark plugs. The oxygen sensors were replaced in October 2021, the mass air flow sensor and the fuel pressure regulator were replaced in June 2022, and wiring was repaired in November 2022.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a five-speed manual transaxle. The clutch assembly was replaced in September 2021.",

      "This 1981 Toyota Pickup is a 4×2 example that is powered by a 2.2-liter diesel inline-four linked with a five-speed manual transmission. The truck was acquired by the seller in 2018 and subsequently refurbished mechanically and cosmetically. Finished in beige over two-tone vinyl upholstery, it is equipped with 14″ steel wheels, power brakes, a sliding rear window, and a tubular rear bumper with a receiver hitch. Previously listed on BaT in February 2023, this diesel pickup is now offered at no reserve in Canada with British Columbia registration in the seller’s name.",
      "The truck was disassembled and sandblasted before it was refinished under current ownership according to the seller, who reports that the bottom of the cab and bed were zinc-plated during the work. Exterior details include a tubular rear bumper, anodized rear window trim, a telescoping antenna, a sliding rear window, vent windows, bed tie-down points, rear mud flaps, and a receiver hitch. The seller states stainless-steel trim has been applied to the top of the cabin and the sides of the windshield, and that the truck wears British Columbia Collector plates. The listing photos are from 2023.",
      "This is a relist after the vehicle was previously sold on BaT in July 2024 and the winning bidder failed to follow through with their commitment to purchase. This was not due to any fault with the vehicle. The winner’s participation on BaT has been restricted and their buyer’s fee was not refunded.",
      "Silver-painted 14″ steel wheels are mounted with 205/75 Hankook Optimo H724 tires. The truck is equipped with KYB shock absorbers, and the power-assisted brake system was overhauled during the refurbishment.",
      "The split bench seat is trimmed in two-tone vinyl and accompanied by color-coordinated door panels and brown carpets. Equipment consists of a heater, manual crank windows, and a push-button AM radio that the seller states does not produce sound.",
      "A two-spoke steering wheel fronts a 140-km/h speedometer and gauges for fuel level and coolant temperature. The six-digit odometer shows 199k kilometers (~124k miles), approximately 1k of which have been added under current ownership. The Carfax report shows a mileage inconsistency in June 2012, and true mileage is unknown.",
      "The 2.2-liter SOHC diesel inline-four was rated at 62 horsepower and 93 lb-ft of torque when new.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a five-speed manual transmission. A shifter bushing was replaced in preparation for the sale along with the fuel sending unit. Additional underbody photos are provided in the gallery.",
      "The Carfax report shows the aforementioned mileage inconsistency in 2012.",
      "The vehicle does not have a title and is being sold on its British Columbia registration, which serves as the ownership document in British Columbia, Canada."

Finished in blue with a power-operated white soft top and matching stripes, the car is equipped with ram-air induction, 14″ Super Stock III wheels, power steering, front disc brakes, and a dual exhaust system, while the cabin is trimmed in blue vinyl upholstery and fitted with power windows, a center console, a Custom Sport steering wheel, and a push-button AM/FM radio. Acquired by the seller in 2020, this 442 convertible is offered with a window sticker and a Massachusetts title in the seller’s name.",

      "The Custom Sport steering wheel sits on a tilting column and fronts a 120-mph speedometer, a tachometer, an analog clock, and supplementary readouts. The five-digit odometer shows 25k miles, approximately 2k of which were added under current ownership. Total mileage is unknown.",
      "The 455ci Rocket V8 is said to have been overhauled in 2021, and it breathes through a four-barrel carburetor and ram-air induction. Approximately 2k miles are said to have been added since the engine overhaul.",
      "Power is routed to the rear wheels through a three-speed Turbo-Hydramatic automatic transmission and a heavy-duty performance rear axle with 3.23:1 gearing.",

An LCD screen is located on each side, displaying a digital speedometer on the left and a fuel gauge on the right along with readouts for ancillary functions. The digital odometer indicates 2,700 miles, all of which were ridden under current ownership.",

    "description": [
      "This 1984 Porsche 911 Carrera coupe was optioned with the M491 “Turbo Look” package, which added front and rear spoilers as well as wider rear bodywork. Finished in black over black leather upholstery, the car is powered by a 3.2-liter flat-six paired with a 915 five-speed manual transaxle and an optional limited-slip differential. Equipment includes 16″ Fuchs alloy wheels with body-color centers as well as a power-operated sunroof, front sport seats, cruise control, a MOMO Steering Wheel, air conditioning, and a Porsche Classic Communication Management (PCCM) head unit. The car was acquired by the selling dealer in 2024 following registration history in Illinois and Indiana, and work performed in preparation for the sale included adjusting the valves and replacing drive belts, brake hoses, rear brake pads, and shifter bushings. This Carrera coupe is offered in California with a Porsche Certificate of Authenticity, manufacturer’s literature, service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Indiana title.",
      "The M491 option was first introduced in 1984 and features front and rear spoilers from the contemporary 911 Turbo as well as wider front and rear fenders. The car is finished in black and features a power-operated sunroof, a rear window wiper, and heated power-adjustable side mirrors. The right fender and left quarter panel have been refinished and paint touch-ups have been applied to the front bumper cover and left quarter panel. There are paint chips on the forward-facing surfaces, and close-up photographs of the exterior finish and trim are shown in the gallery below.",
      "The 16″ Fuchs alloy wheels feature body-color centers and anodized lips and are mounted with Michelin Pilot Sport tires. The M491 package included Turbo-specification brakes, anti-roll bars, trailing arms, and torsion bars as well as Turbo brake calipers with drilled rotors. The brake fluid was changed and the brake hoses and rear brake pads were replaced in 2024.",
      "The cabin features front sport seats upholstered in black leather. Amenities include cruise control, air conditioning, power windows, and a Porsche Classic Communication Management head unit.",
      "The three-spoke leather-wrapped MOMO steering wheel frames VDO instrumentation including a central tachometer with a 6,300-rpm redline as well as a 170-mph speedometer, a Quarz clock, and gauges for oil level, oil pressure, oil temperature, and fuel level. The six-digit odometer shows 104k miles. The Carfax report indicates that a Not Actual Mileage title was issued in Illinois in April 1991, which the selling dealer attributes to a clerical error. Total mileage is unknown. The removed factory three-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel is included in the sale.",
      "The 3.2-liter M930/21 flat-six was factory rated at 200 horsepower and 185 lb-ft of torque, and a top-end rebuild was performed in 2007. The valves and throttle linkage were adjusted, the oil was changed, and the oil level sender gasket and drive belts were replaced in June 2024. Documentation of the rebuild is provided in the image gallery below.",
      "Engine stamping *64E03605* is presented above and matches the number listed on the Porsche Certificate of Authenticity. Transaxle stamping 74510308 is shown in the gallery below and also matches the Certificate of Authenticity.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a Type 915 five-speed manual transaxle and an optional limited-slip differential. The clutch was replaced in 2007, and the shifter bushings were replaced in 2024.",
      "The Porsche Certificate of Authenticity shows factory colors, equipment, and a production completion date of March 15, 1984. Manufacturer’s literature and service records will accompany the sale.",
      "The Carfax report shows the aforementioned April 1991 Not Actual Miles title",
      "Head over to our friends at Car and Driver to check out their February 1984 Road Test for the 911 Carrera."

      "This 2015 Mercedes-Benz C63 AMG Coupe was purchased new by the seller at Mercedes-Benz Boundary in Vancouver, British Columbia, with the Edition 507 package that included upgraded engine components, a vented aluminum hood, carbon-fiber interior trim, forged AMG 19″ wheels, and upgraded brakes. Finished in Polar White over white leather and black Alcantara upholstery, it also has bi-xenon headlights, active corner illumination, a panoramic sunroof, COMAND infotainment with navigation, heated front seats, and a Harman Kardon sound system. Power comes from a 6.2-liter V8 paired with a seven-speed AMG Speedshift MCT transmission. The car has 3,500 kilometers (~2,200 miles), fewer than 150 of which were added since it was previously listed on BaT in September 2022. This C63 AMG is now offered at no reserve in Canada with manufacturer’s literature, a clean Carfax report, and British Columbia registration.",
      "The body features AMG-specific bumper covers and hood vents as well as an Edition 507 gloss black rear spoiler and mirror caps. Additional details include a panoramic sunroof, active corner illumination, bi-xenon headlights, parking sensors, a rear diffuser, and quadruple exhaust outlets.",
      "AMG 19″ forged wheels are mounted with 235/35 front and 255/30 rear Continental ContiSportContact tires. Red AMG-branded brake calipers are fitted over drilled and slotted rotors at all four corners.",
      "The heated and power-adjustable front seats are upholstered in Designo white leather with black Alcantara inserts, and carbon-fiber trim accents the cabin, which has front seat position memory, Keyless Go, dual-zone automatic climate control, Harman Kardon audio, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, COMAND infotainment with navigation, and Edition 507 badging.",
      "An Alcantara-wrapped steering wheel frames a 320-km/h speedometer, a tachometer, auxiliary gauges, and an LCD screen. The digital odometer indicates 3,500 kilometers (~2,200 miles).",
      "The 6.2-liter M156 V8 was factory rated at 507 horsepower and 450 lb-ft of torque in Edition 507 trim, and it sends power to the rear wheels through a seven-speed automatic transmission. The ignition coil for cylinder seven was replaced in preparation for the sale.",
      "Additional photos of the underside are provided in the gallery below.",
      "The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage.",
      "The vehicle does not have a title and is being sold on its British Columbia registration, which serves as the ownership document in British Columbia, Canada."

      "This 1965 Oldsmobile 442 convertible is powered by a 400ci V8 linked to a three-speed Turbo Hydra-Matic automatic transmission and is finished in red with a power-operated white soft top over red vinyl upholstery. Equipment includes Super Sport 15″ wheels, red-line tires, power steering, power-assisted drum brakes, dual exhaust, front bucket seats, and Sunpro auxiliary gauges. The vehicle was refurbished at some point prior to 2018, and the current owner purchased the car in 2021. Subsequent service is said to have involved overhauling the brakes and replacing the voltage regulator, tires, points, fuel sending unit, windshield, and tailpipes. This 442 is now offered at no reserve on dealer consignment with a set of hubcaps, a trickle charger, and a clean Florida title.",
      "Oldsmobile produced 3,468 Cutlass convertibles with the 442 performance package for 1965. Finished from the factory in Target Red with a black convertible top (R-1), this car has been repainted in red and fitted with a power-operated white convertible top. Equipment includes a red top boot, quad headlights, chrome bumpers, bright trim, 442 badging, a driver-side mirror, and reverse lights. The windshield and windshield molding reportedly were replaced in 2022. The seller notes that much of the exterior anodized and stainless trim has not been refurbished and exhibits pitting.",
      "Super Sport 15″ wheels are mounted with 205/70 BFGoodrich Silvertown Radial double-red-line tires. The car is equipped with power steering, and braking is provided by power-assisted drums at all four corners. In April 2021, the tires are said to have been replaced along with the brake master cylinder, rear shoes, hardware, and wheel cylinders.",
      "The cabin features front bucket seats and a rear bench that have been reupholstered in red vinyl and are accented by coordinating door panels and replacement red carpeting. Appointments include lap belts, patterned-metal dash trim, a heater, and a locking glovebox. The retro-style aftermarket stereo in the dashboard is inoperative.",
      "The two-spoke steering wheel sits ahead of a sweeping 120-mph speedometer and a fuel-level gauge. A Sunpro tachometer is attached to the steering column near Sunpro gauges for coolant temperature, voltage, and oil pressure. The five-digit odometer shows 13k miles, approximately 850 of which were added under current ownership. Total mileage is unknown.",
      "The 400ci V8 is equipped with a four-barrel carburetor and was factory rated at 345 horsepower and 440 lb-ft of torque. The voltage regulator was replaced in 2021, and work in 2022 included replacing the points and the fuel sending unit, adjusting the timing and the carburetor, and flushing the radiator.",
      "Power is routed to the rear wheels through a three-speed Turbo Hydra-Matic automatic transmission. The dual exhaust system’s tailpipes and hangars were replaced in 2022, according to the selling dealer.",

      "This 2001 Porsche Boxster S is finished in Zanzibar Red over black full supple leather and is powered by a 3.2-liter flat-six paired with a six-speed manual transaxle. It has remained on the East Coast since new and now has 63k miles. Equipment includes the Sport Touring and Power Seat packages as well as a black soft top, 18″ Turbo-look wheels, xenon headlights, a speed-activated rear spoiler, cruise control, a Bluetooth-capable Alpine CD stereo, and a Hi-Fi sound system with DSP. Recently acquired by the selling dealer, this 986 Boxster S is now offered with a window sticker, the owner’s manual, service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean New Jersey title.",
      "The car is finished in Zanzibar Red and features a black soft top with a replacement rear window. Additional features include xenon headlights, a speed-activated rear spoiler, side air intake scoops, roll hoops, and clear front side markers. The seller notes wear on the soft top fabric, a patched tear in the top rear window, and blemishes in the finish as depicted in the photo gallery along with photos of paint meter readings.",
      "The 18″ Turbo-look wheels are mounted with Michelin Pilot Super Sport front and Michelin Pilot Sport 4S rear tires measuring 225/40 and 265/35, respectively. Braking is handled by four-piston Porsche-branded calipers fitted over cross-drilled rotors at all four corners.",
      "The cabin features power-adjustable seats upholstered in black supple leather, and color-coordinated leather extends to the dashboard and door panels. Features include driver seat-position memory settings, a wind deflector, cruise control, automatic climate control, a Bluetooth-capable Alpine CD stereo, and a Hi-Fi sound system with Digital Sound Processing (DSP). The seller states that the instrument binnacle leather upholstery has been replaced, and a climate control screen was replaced in preparation for the sale. The center console hinge is missing.",
      "The leather-wrapped steering wheel fronts a central tachometer, a 180-mph speedometer, and gauges for coolant temperature and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 63k miles.",
      "The mid-mounted 3.2L flat-six was factory rated at 250 horsepower and 225 lb-ft of torque. Records indicate that the IMS bearing was replaced in September 2013 at 35k miles at which time the rear main seal was also replaced. The oil was most recently changed in June 2023.",
      "Power is routed to the rear wheels via a six-speed manual transaxle. The clutch components were replaced along with the flywheel and pilot bearing in September 2013 at 35k miles.",
      "The window sticker notes initial delivery to Leith Incorporated in Cary, North Carolina, and lists factory equipment, colors, options, and a total price of $61,252. The owner’s manual, tools, and service records are also included in the sale.",
      "The Carfax report notes at least one recall.",
      "Head over to our friends at Car and Driver to check out their January 2000 Road Test for the 986 Boxster S."

      "This 1973 BMW R75/5 is a long-wheelbase (LWB) example that was acquired by the seller in November 2019, reportedly from the spouse of its original owner. It subsequently earned a Vintage Award at the June 2022 BMW MOA Rally in Springfield, Missouri, which celebrated the 50th anniversary of the /5. The bike finished in blue with white pinstripes and is powered by a 745cc opposed twin paired with a four-speed transmission. Equipment includes an enclosed driveshaft, an electric starter, a chrome dual exhaust system, dual Bing carburetors, 19″ front and 18″ rear wire-spoke wheels, panniers, and a black vinyl-upholstered two-up seat. This R75/5 LWB is offered with an owner’s manual, service records, spare parts, a tool kit, and a clean Michigan title in the seller’s name.",
      "The bike is finished in Blue Metallic (539), and equipment includes a grab bar, a left-side lift-assist handle, both center and side stands, panniers, dual mirrors, and a black vinyl-upholstered two-up seat.",
      "Wire-spoke wheels with alloy rims were mounted with 3.25-19″ front and 4.00-18″ rear Metzeler Block C5 tires in November 2019 at which time the rims were polished and the spokes were replaced. Stopping power is provided by front and rear drums. Suspension consists of a leading-axle fork as well as dual shocks mounted to the swingarm on the left and the final-drive enclosure on the right. The fork seals were replaced in November 2022. The increase in wheelbase was a mid-year change by BMW, with LWB models identifiable by the 50mm (~2″) welded-in section just forward of the swingarm flange where it bolts to the rear drive.",
      "The handlebar is mounted to the upper triple clamp via a pair of risers that frame the adjustment knob for a steering damper. The headlight nacelle houses a MotoMeter combination gauge, which contains a 120-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 6,800-rpm redline. The five-digit odometer shows 3,500 miles, approximately 3k of which were ridden by the seller.",
      "The 745cc opposed twin features an electric starter, a chrome dual exhaust system with a crossover tube, and dual Bing carburetors. Factory-rated output was 50 horsepower and 44 lb-ft of torque. The pushrod tube seals were replaced in August 2022 and the oil was last changed in May 2024.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheel through a four-speed transmission and a driveshaft enclosed within the right leg of the swingarm.",
      "The number 4004938 stamped on the engine case matches with the numbers stamped on the frame and steering headstock tag.",
      "The Michigan title carries a “Duplicate” notation under the Brand or Legend section."

The bike is finished in Tahitian Red, and equipment includes a five-speed transmission, 21″ and 18″ alloy wire-spoke wheels, a black-finished upswept expansion-chamber exhaust, high-mounted fenders, preload-adjustable shocks, and drum brakes. This CR250R is now offered at no reserve in Ohio for off-road use only with a bill of sale.",

Suspension consists of a leading-axle telescopic fork as well as dual preload-adjustable shocks mounted to the swingarm. Braking is provided by drums at both ends.",

Finished in black with gold graphics, the motorcycle is powered by an overbored 745cc air-cooled parallel twin paired with a four-speed transmission that was rebuilt by Colorado Norton Works. It is also equipped with a single Mikuni carburetor, Boyer Bransden electronic ignition, a Colorado Norton Works single-coil conversion and three-phase alternator system, an overhauled front disc brake, Ikon rear shocks, a Roadholder telescopic fork with Teflon-lined bushings and Lansdowne adjustable dampers, and laced wheels with shouldered rims as well as a two-up seat, amber turn signals, and both center and side stands. This Commando is offered at no reserve with workshop manuals, spare parts, service and parts invoices, and a Washington title in the seller’s name.",
      "The motorcycle is finished in black with gold graphics. Features include a chrome-plated headlight shell, amber turn signals, a combined stoplight and taillight, a black vinyl-upholstered two-up seat with a passenger grab strap, and folding passenger foot pegs along with both center and side stands. A portion of the gallery photos were taken in July 2023.",
      "The laced wheels feature stainless-steel spokes, replacement wheel bearings, and shouldered rims measuring 19″ up front and 18″ out back, and they are mounted with Bridgestone Battlax BT45 tires. The Roadholder telescopic fork has been fitted with Cosentino Engineering Teflon-lined bushings under current ownership along with Lansdowne dampers, which enable adjustment of compression and rebound damping. An aftermarket one-piece rear axle has been installed, and rear suspension is provided by a pair of Ikon shocks attached to the swingarm.",
      "The seller notes that the front brake disc was resurfaced and drilled under current ownership, and additional front brake work involved installing an Andover Norton 13mm front brake master cylinder and Ferodo brake pads were installed as well as rebuilding the Norton-Lockheed front brake caliper with replacement seals and pistons. A drum brake provides stopping power at the rear.",
      "The chrome-finished handlebar frames a Smiths 150-mph speedometer and a matching tachometer with a 7k-rpm redline. The five-digit odometer shows 46k miles, approximately 600 of which were ridden under current ownership.",
      "The overbored 745cc air-cooled parallel twin was rebuilt under previous ownership, with reported work having included boring the cylinders to accept .060″-oversized pistons and fitting the cylinder head with replacement valves, guides, spark plug and exhaust thread inserts, and seals as well as installing a single Mikuni carburetor, a Boyer Bransden electronic ignition system, and a Colorado Norton Works single-coil conversion, three-phase alternator system, and ARP barrel and head bolt kits. The oil tank was modified by Colorado Norton Works in 2014.",
      "Power is transferred to the rear wheel through a four-speed transmission with a right-side shifter as well as a drive chain. The transmission was rebuilt by Colorado Norton Works in 2015, and the bike has been fitted with a Colorado Norton Works clutch.",
      "The number 221643 stamped on the engine case matches the number stamped on the headstock plate, a photo of which is provided in the gallery.",

      "This 1975 Bricklin SV-1 is said to have remained in Canada with its first owner before being acquired by the seller’s father in 1996. It is finished in red over a tan interior and powered by a 351ci Windsor V8 paired with a three-speed automatic transmission. The car is equipped with air-actuated gullwing doors, pop-up headlights, 15″ Turbo Mag aluminum wheels, power-assisted front disc brakes, a dual exhaust system, air conditioning, and a factory radio. This SV-1 shows 5k miles and is offered by the seller on behalf of their mother with a service manual, a parts catalog, appraisal reports, historical photos, awards, spare parts, and Ontario registration.",
      "The SV-1 features acrylic resin body panels bonded to a fiberglass substrate, which are mounted on a steel frame with an integrated rollover structure. A claimed 2,100 examples were produced for the 1975 model year, and this one was repainted in its current shade of red around 1995. Design cues include pop-up headlights, impact bumpers, and gullwing doors that have been converted to air actuation. Crazing on the hood and areas of touch-up paint are noted by the seller.",
      "Machine-finished 15″ Turbo Mag aluminum wheels are wrapped in BFGoodrich Radial T/A white-letter tires that were mounted in 2022. Power steering was equipped as standard along with power-assisted front discs and rear drums.",
      "The bucket seats are covered in two-tone tan vinyl and suede microfiber cloth, and they are accompanied by a color-coordinated dashboard and door panels. Equipment includes a factory radio, a three-spoke President steering wheel, air conditioning, and a rear defroster.",
      "VDO instrumentation includes a 160-mph speedometer and a tachometer, while gauges for voltage, coolant temperature, oil pressure, and fuel level are located in the center stack. The five-digit odometer shows 5k miles, approximately 3k of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The Ford-supplied 351ci Windsor V8 was factory rated at 175 horsepower and 286 lb-ft of torque. The seller notes that the alternator was replaced in 2022 and the carburetor was rebuilt in 2023.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a Ford FMX three-speed automatic transmission. The exhaust butterfly has been removed.",
      "Historical photos are provided in the gallery below.",
      "The vehicle is being sold on its Ontario registration, which serves as the ownership document in Ontario, Canada. The sale does not include a title."

The truck was acquired by the selling dealer in 2023, and the engine is said to have been subsequently overhauled. This FZJ80 is offered in California at no reserve with build invoices, an accident-free Carfax report, and a Texas title.",

The vehicle also features a sunroof, power-adjustable side mirrors, and a rear window wiper.",

The suspension has been modified with a Slee Off Road lift kit as well as an Old Man Emu steering stabilizer and dampers. Stopping power is handled by four-wheel discs with ABS, and the brakes were serviced under current ownership. The selling dealer states that a replacement power steering gearbox and axles have been installed and the hubs were rebuilt.",

Additional equipment includes air conditioning, a digital clock, all-weather floor mats, and an Alpine head unit linked to Infinity door speakers. Additional work is said to have involved replacing the headliner and carpeting as well as the A-pillar trim and door panel inserts.",
      "The four-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a 130-mph speedometer, a tachometer, and supplementary gauges. The six-digit odometer shows 306k miles, approximately 350 of which were added under current ownership. The Carfax report lists a mileage inconsistency in November 2023, with a note that it “may just be a clerical error.”",

An air compressor has been mounted in the engine bay, and the oil and spark plugs were changed in November 2023. Additional service is said to have involved installing a replacement alternator, air conditioning compressor, and intake and exhaust manifolds. Photos taken during the engine work can be seen in the gallery. The truck has not passed a California emissions test.",
      "Power is routed to all four wheels through a four-speed automatic transmission and a dual-range transfer case that were rebuilt in March 2022 by Snider Transmission in La Porte, Texas. The truck has a locking center differential, and the selling dealer notes aftermarket gear sets have been added along with front and rear ARB air-locker differentials. The transfer case and differentials were recently serviced.",

    "description": [
      "This 1985 Stutz Bearcat is one of a claimed seven Series IV examples produced between 1979 and 1987 and is said to have spent 18 years in a museum collection before it was purchased by the selling dealer in 2023. The car is finished in two-tone silver and black and features simulated side exhaust pipes, removable roof panels, a targa bar, and a power-operated rear soft top. Inside, the power-adjustable front seats are trimmed in gray upholstery and accompanied by gold-plated interior trim, a wood-rimmed steering wheel, air conditioning, and an Alpine CD stereo. Power comes from a 5.0L V8 paired with a three-speed automatic transmission, and further equipment includes power steering, power-assisted front disc brakes, and 15″ chrome wire wheels. This Stutz Bearcat is now offered with a top boot, a jack, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Oregon title.",
      "The Stutz marque was revived in the late 1960s with the Virgil Exner–designed Blackhawk. The later Bearcat convertible model was based on contemporary General Motors A platform running gear and produced from 1979 through 1987. This example was built using the chassis and powertrain from a 1983 Oldsmobile Delta 88 Royale and features hand-built coachwork by Carrozzeria Saturn of Torino, Italy.",
      "The car is finished in silver and black and features bumper-mounted headlights and driving lamps, simulated exhaust pipes that emerge from the front fenders, removable roof panels, a targa bar, and a power-operated rear soft top. A black top boot is included in the sale.",
      "The 15″ chrome wire wheels feature faux knock-off hubs and are mounted with 215/75 Milestar whitewall tires. A spare is stowed under a vinyl cover on the rear decklid. The car is equipped with power steering, while braking is handled by power-assisted front discs and rear drums.",
      "The cabin features power-adjustable front bucket seats and a rear bench trimmed in gray upholstery with black piping along with a color-matched dashpad, center console, and door panels. A plaque with the original owner’s name is affixed to the glovebox door, and burl wood trim with gold-plated accents are present on the dash, center console, and doors. Additional equipment includes an Alpine CD stereo, air conditioning, and power windows.",
      "The wood-rimmed steering wheel features gold-plated spokes as well as a Stutz horn button. It frames a horizontal-sweep 85-mph speedometer and a fuel gauge. The five-digit odometer shows 96k miles, less than 100 of which have been added by the selling dealer.",
      "The 5.0-liter V8 is equipped with a four-barrel carburetor. An oil change was performed in 2024.",
      "A plaque engraved with the names of the coachbuilders who built the body is affixed to the radiator fan shroud.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels via a three-speed automatic transmission.",
      "The Carfax report lists the car as a 1983 Oldsmobile Delta 88 Royale and notes that it was designated a gross polluter twice by the state of California in 1999.",
      "The car is titled as a 1985 Stutz Delta convertible."

      "This 1972 BMW 3.0CSi was completed on October 17, 1972, and delivered new to BMW of Italy in Palazzolo. The car was relocated in 1995 to the Netherlands, where a refurbishment was completed in 2017 by Oldenzaal Classics, and it was imported to the US by its current owner in 2022. Finished in Polaris Silver over blue leather upholstery, it has a stainless-steel exhaust system, four-wheel disc brakes, 14″ Alpina wheels, power windows, a Blaupunkt cassette player, and a Nardi steering wheel. Power comes from a fuel-injected 3.0L inline-six paired with a four-speed manual transmission. Service in June 2023 involved replacing the water pump, cooling fan, and left-front rubber brake hose. This E9 coupe was previously listed on BaT in September 2023, and it is now offered on dealer consignment in Pennsylvania with an owner’s manual, refurbishment records, and a clean Montana title.",
      "The Karmann-built body was repainted in its factory Polaris Silver during the project, and the windshield, rocker covers, fender grilles, headlights, emblems, rubber bumper moldings, and body seals were replaced. Dual mirrors, a rear fog light, and a retractable antenna are additional elements.",
      "Silver 14″ Alpina wheels are mounted with 205/70 Vredestein Sprint Classic tires that show 2016 production date codes. Lowered suspension is noted, and rebuilds of the brake master cylinder and brake calipers are said to have been completed during the refurbishment. A replacement left-front brake hose was installed in June 2023, at which time the brake fluid was flushed.",
      "The front bucket seats and contoured rear bench were reupholstered in blue leather during the refurbishment, which also involved replacing the carpets, while the car’s door cards and headliner were retained. Additional equipment includes power windows, a Blaupunkt cassette player, a heater, a rear window defroster, and wood accents on the dashboard and doors.",
      "A Nardi wood-rimmed steering wheel frames a 240-km/h speedometer, an 8k-rpm tachometer, a combination gauge, and a clock. The five-digit odometer is said to have rolled over once and shows 54k kilometers (~34k miles), approximately 300 of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The 3.0-liter M30B30 inline-six features an aluminum cylinder head and Bosch D-Jetronic fuel injection. Service in June 2023 involved replacing the water pump, cooling fan, and fan clutch.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels via a four-speed manual transmission. A stainless-steel exhaust system was installed during the refurbishment, and the underside was coated with Dinitrol anti-rust treatment."

    "description": [
      "This 1985 Porsche 928S was initially delivered through Rusnak Porsche in Pasadena, California, and was acquired by the current owner in 1987. The car is powered by a 5.0-liter V8 paired with a four-speed automatic transaxle and is finished in Guards Red (80K) over black leather. Equipment includes four-wheel disc brakes, 16″ polished alloy wheels, pop-up headlights, a sunroof, a rear spoiler, power-adjustable front seats, air conditioning, and power windows. Work in 2023 included servicing the engine and transaxle, rebuilding the torque tube and steering rack, and overhauling the air conditioning system. This 928S is offered by the seller on behalf of their spouse with service records, an accident-free Carfax report, and a British Columbia registration.",
      "The car is finished in Guards Red (80K) and features pop-up headlights with washers as well as fog lights, power-adjustable side mirrors, body-color side skirts, a steel sunroof, a rear window wiper, and a rear spoiler. Stitched repairs to the cracked front chin spoiler are depicted in the gallery.",
      "Polished 16″ seven-hole alloy wheels are mounted with 225/50 Bridgestone Potenza tires. Braking is handled by power-assisted discs at each corner. The power steering rack was rebuilt in 2023.",
      "The power-adjustable front bucket and folding individual rear seats are trimmed in black leather. Appointments include air conditioning, cruise control, and power windows. The hatch release mechanism was recently serviced and the Blaupunkt cassette stereo does not work.",
      "The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a 170-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 6k-rpm redline as well as supplementary gauges for coolant temperature, fuel level, oil pressure, and voltage. The six-digit odometer shows 40k miles, approximately 25k of which were added under current ownership. The Carfax report notes a mileage inconsistency in March 1992, which is thought to be a clerical error related to a mile/kilometer conversion when the car moved to Canada. The combination gauge for voltage and oil pressure was replaced in 2023.",
      "The 5.0-liter V8 was factory rated at 288 horsepower and 302 lb-ft of torque. Work in July 2023 included powdercoating the engine parts, replating the engine hardware, resurfacing the cylinder heads, overhauling the air conditioning system, and installing the following replacement components:",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a rear-mounted four-speed automatic transaxle. The torque tube was rebuilt and the torque converter bearings were replaced in 2023.",
      "In-process photos of the 2023 engine-out service are presented in the gallery.",
      "The Carfax report shows no accidents or other damage, notes the aforementioned mileage inconsistency, and lists history in California and British Columbia Canada from the initial entry in March 1992.",
      "The car does not have a title as it is registered in a province that does not issue titles for vehicles. It is being sold on its transferrable British Columbia registration."

      "This 1941 Graham Hollywood Model 109 is a non-running project that was disassembled by its previous owner of 64 years before it was purchased by the selling dealer in 2024. Body panels wear gray primer, and the car retains a General Motors-sourced inline-six and a three-speed manual transmission. A collection of spare parts is included in the sale and features grille and external trim pieces, headlights, gauges, seats, and a radiator. This Graham Hollywood project is now offered at no reserve in Ulster Park, New York, with a clean Indiana title.",
      "The Hollywood featured front-end styling by John Tjaarda, while bodywork from the cowl aft was produced using body dies from the Cord 810/812, which Graham-Paige had acquired from the Hupp Motor Car Corporation in early 1940. Production for Hollywood models and the similar Hupmobile Skylark was limited to five months before Graham retooled in September 1940 to focus on defense contracts. This example was reportedly sandblasted before being finished in primer under previous ownership. Areas of rust are presented in the gallery below.",
      "Steel wheels are finished in gray, and they wear older whitewall tires.",
      "The cabin is stripped, and areas of the floorboards have been cut out. Corrosion on the cabin and trunk floors can be seen in the gallery.",
      "The banjo-style steering wheel is mounted ahead of the steel dash, which is absent its instruments. A Camaro-branded wood shift knob tops the floor shifter.",
      "The factory 217.8ci L-head inline-six with water-cooled centrifugal supercharger was replaced with a General Motors-sourced inline-six under previous ownership.",
      "A three-speed manual transmission is retained.",
      "Spare parts including exterior brightwork, headlights, gauges, seats, and mechanical components are included in the sale and are further detailed in the gallery."

      "This 1970 Volkswagen Karmann Ghia coupe is powered by an air-cooled 1,776cc flat-four and was acquired by the seller in April 2022. Subsequent work included converting the car from a semi-automatic transaxle to a four-speed manual, refreshing the upholstery, repainting the body in Pampas Yellow, and fitting 15″ Fuchs-style wheels, dropped spindles, and an adjustable axle beam. Additional details include front disc brakes, a CB Performance Maganspark ignition system, a BMD serpentine belt kit, a full-flow oiling system, a Monza-style exhaust system, front lap belts, faux woodgrain dashboard trim, and a wire basket with integrated cupholders. This Karmann Ghia coupe is now offered with refurbishment records and a clean California title in the seller’s name.",
      "The car left the factory finished in Pampas Yellow (L10E) and received a repaint and replacement seals under current ownership. Exterior details include a left side-view mirror, tinted windows, polished trim, pop-out rear quarter windows, a Karmann badge on the right front fender, and chrome bumpers with overriders. The latch on the fuel filler door is broken.",
      "Fuchs-style 15″ alloy wheels are mounted with 155/60 Kumho tires up front and 165/65 Continental rubber out back. The car has been lowered by reindexing the rear torsion arms and installing an adjustable front axle beam and replacement spindles. Stopping power is provided by front discs and rear drums.",
      "The low-back front bucket seats and folding rear bench are trimmed in tan vinyl and beige cloth upholstery. Interior elements include black door panels and carpeting, front lap belts, faux woodgrain dashboard trim, and a wire basket with integrated cupholders. The horn, cassette stereo, dome light, and rear window defroster are inoperative.",
      "The two-spoke steering wheel wears an aftermarket wrap and frames a 90-mph speedometer and a fuel-level gauge. The five-digit mechanical odometer shows 65k miles, and true mileage is unknown. The analog clock does not work.",
      "The replacement air-cooled 1,776cc flat-four is fed by a single downdraft carburetor topped with an oil bath air cleaner and is equipped with a CB Performance Maganspark ignition system, a BMD serpentine belt kit, a full-flow oiling system, and a Monza-style exhaust system with heater boxes. The engine leaks oil.",
      "Initially outfitted with an Automatic Stickshift semi-automatic transaxle, the car now delivers power to the rear wheels through a four-speed manual transaxle."

    "description": [
      "This 1985 Honda ATC 70 was first sold by Honda-Kawasaki of Lemon Grove, California, and remained in the state with the family of its original owner until the seller acquired it in 2023. Subsequent work included refinishing the 7″ steel wheels and exhaust and replacing the blue vinyl solo seat, steering stem bearings, tires, fuel lines, and more as detailed below. Power comes from a 72cc OHC four-stroke single mated to a four-speed transmission with an automatic clutch, and the three-wheeler is equipped with an enclosed drive chain, a recoil starter, a rear drum brake, a thumb throttle, and a 1.1-gallon fuel tank finished in red. This ATC 70 is now offered at no reserve with initial purchase documents and a clean Arizona title in the seller’s name.",
      "The three-wheeler is finished in red with two-tone blue Honda decals and features a 1.1-gallon fuel tank, a chrome rear grab bar, plastic fenders, and rubber-covered foot pegs. A blue vinyl solo seat was installed and the rear decal and fuel filler cap gasket were replaced following the seller’s acquisition. A blemish on the lower-left area of the fuel tank is noted by the seller.",
      "The 7″ steel wheels were refinished in silver and mounted with replacement knobby tires in 2023, and the steering stem bearings were also replaced at that time. Stopping power is provided by a drum brake mounted to the rear axle. The three-wheeler is not equipped with suspension.",
      "The chrome-finished handlebar was fitted with replacement grips under current ownership, and it is equipped with a thumb-actuated throttle, an ignition cutoff switch, and a front brake lever. The ATC is not equipped with an odometer or other instrumentation, therefore total mileage is unknown.",
      "The air-cooled 72cc OHC four-stroke single is equipped with a recoil starter, a 13mm piston-valve carburetor, magneto ignition, and an exhaust system with a perforated heat shield that exits below the rear fenders. Power is delivered to the rear wheels through a four-speed transmission with an automatic clutch as well as an enclosed drive chain. Work following the seller’s acquisition included flushing the fuel system, replacing the spark plug and fuel lines, and refinishing the exhaust system."

Amenities include a padded dashboard, an AM/FM stereo, and faux woodgrain trim on the instrument panel and center console. The belt for the air conditioning compressor is removed, and the air conditioning does not work.",

      "Power is routed to the rear wheels through a three-speed automatic transmission. A replacement dual exhaust system is installed.",
      "Decoding the trim tag reveals the following information:",

It is finished in Spruce Green Metallic over Saffron leather upholstery and is powered by a 3.2-liter M104 inline-six paired with a four-speed automatic transmission. Equipment includes a power-operated sunroof, eight-hole 15″ wheels, heated power-adjustable front seats, driver’s seat position memory, central locking, and power windows and side mirrors. Acquired by the selling dealer in 2024, this C124 E320 coupe is offered in Canada at no reserve with service records, a clean Carfax report, and Ontario registration.",
      "The car is finished in Spruce Green Metallic (249) with color-matched lower cladding. Features include a power-operated sunroof, a mono-blade windshield wiper, and a power antenna and side mirrors. The antenna was repaired in July 2024. A blemish is noted on the bottom right rear window, and close-up photos of the paintwork and trim are presented in the gallery.",

Interior appointments include driver’s seat position memory, central locking, rubber floor mats, a passenger airbag, and power windows. A factory CD changer is located in the trunk. The air conditioning was recharged in preparation for the sale. The cruise control system is inoperative and the selling dealer notes cracks in the wood console trim.",
      "The leather-wrapped airbag steering wheel frames VDO instrumentation consisting of a 260-km/h speedometer and a tachometer as well as an analog clock and gauges for coolant temperature, oil pressure, and fuel level. The six-digit odometer shows 165k kilometers (~103k miles), approximately 300 of which were added under current ownership.",

    "description": [
      "This 1998 Honda Acty SDX is a right-hand-drive pickup that is said to have been used by a fire department near Kobe, Japan, before being imported to the US in 2024. It is finished in red over gray cloth and powered by an E07A 656cc inline-three paired with a five-speed manual transaxle. It features four-wheel drive, 13″ powder-coated wheels, Honda vinyl graphics, an emergency beacon, front disc brakes, a work light, drop sides, mud flaps, a radio, and a cabin heater. Accompanying the truck is a 1981 Honda CT70 that is powered by a replacement 125cc four-stroke single paired with a four-speed manual transmission. This Acty SDX is now offered at no reserve by the selling dealer with an owner’s manual, service records, and a clean Washington title for the Acty.",
      "The truck is said to have been refinished in red in Japan and features a work light, a tailgate and drop sides, front window visors, and mud flaps. Additional equipment includes white Honda vinyl graphics, yellow fog lights, a roof-mounted emergency beacon, and a rack-mounted spare fuel can. A wheel chock, tie-down straps, and a folding aluminum ramp accompany the truck. There are scratches on the truck bed and the left-side tailgate rubber bump stop is missing.",
      "The Honda VX 13″ wheels were powder-coated white and mounted with 165/80 Forceum tires. Braking is provided by front discs and rear drums.",
      "The seating surfaces are upholstered in gray cloth, and interior equipment includes a radio and a cabin heater. There are oil stains on the passenger seat and the siren for the CB radio was removed before the truck was imported.",
      "The two-spoke steering wheel is situated at the right side of the cabin and frames a 130-km/h speedometer, which displays recommended shift points and is flanked gauges for coolant temperature and fuel level. The six-digit odometer shows 5k kilometers (~3,700 miles), fewer than 30 of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The E07A 656cc inline-three was factory rated at 38 horsepower and 40 lb-ft of torque. The fluids were changed and the battery replaced in June 2024.",
      "Power is sent to the rear or all four wheels through a five-speed manual transaxle.",
      "The CT70 features a hollow T-bone frame, and this example is finished in white with black, red, and white graphics along with white fenders. Equipment includes a solo seat, a headlight, 10″ wheels, a conventional fork, drum brakes, and a side stand.",
      "Twist-locking folding handlebars frame a replacement Nippon Seiki 50-mph speedometer that displays recommended shift points. The five-digit odometer shows 5k miles, and the total mileage is unknown.",
      "The replacement 125cc four-stroke single features a kick starter, electronic ignition, a sidedraft carburetor, and an upswept exhaust system with a chrome-finished heat shield. Power is sent to the rear wheel through a four-speed manual transmission as well as a drive chain protected by a black-finished guard.",
      "The CT70 does not have a title or registration and is being sold on a bill of sale only.",
      "The Acty’s Washington title is noted as a duplicate."

The digital odometer indicates 107k miles, approximately 7k of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The 4.4-liter M62TUB44 V8 was factory rated at 282 horsepower and 324 lb-ft of torque. The oil was most recently changed in November 2022, at which time the coolant was flushed. The rear main seal, alternator, and coolant pump were replaced in 2023.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a ZF five-speed automatic transmission. The transmission output shaft seal was replaced in November 2022.",

Equipment includes Pierre Cardin badging, Cragar wheels, whitewall tires, power steering, front disc brakes, headers, and side-exit exhaust pipes. The brakes were overhauled in preparation for the sale, and the car has not been regularly driven since 2022. This Javelin project is now offered by the seller on behalf of the owning dealer with 1980-dated registration paperwork and a clean Massachusetts title.",
      "The car has been repainted in black with purple accents over each wheel. Additional exterior elements include aftermarket headlamps, “426 Hemi” grille badging, a driver-side mirror, side-exhaust pipes, bright trim, and chrome bumpers with rubber overriders. Pierre Cardin badging is affixed to both front fenders. The seller states that the driver door has been replaced. Checked paint, rust-through, and other imperfections are pictured in the gallery below, and evidence of unpainted body work is visible on the passenger side of the vehicle.",
      "Bright-finished Cragar 15″ wheels are mounted with American Classic whitewall tires; the wheels exhibit corrosion. The seller states that the master cylinder was replaced in 2023 and that the rear wheel cylinders and brake shoes were replaced in July 2024 and the front brake calipers were rebuilt.",

Appointments include Pierre Cardin logos, a center console, a horseshoe-style shift lever, a push-button radio, a heater, woodgrain accents, and bright doorsill trim. A stain on the passenger seat is shown in the gallery, and rust is evident in the trunk compartment.",

      "This 1994 BMW R100GS is finished in black with a yellow brush guard and powered by an air-cooled 980cc opposed twin mated to a five-speed transmission and an enclosed driveshaft. A Parabellum clear windscreen has been added, and the bike is further equipped with a black and yellow vinyl two-up seat, hand guards, BMW hard-sided panniers, and wire-spoke wheels with Akront rims as well as a Paralever single-sided swingarm, a front disc brake, a pair of Bing carburetors, and a two-into-one exhaust system. Acquired by the seller in 2023, this R100GS is now offered at no reserve with a rider’s manual, a tool roll, spare parts, two additional two-up seats, the removed clear windscreen, and a clean South Carolina title in the seller’s name.",
      "The 5.8-gallon fuel tank, front fairing, and fenders are finished in black, while the front brush guard is finished in yellow. The bike is equipped with a Parabellum clear windscreen, a black and yellow vinyl two-up seat, removable hard-sided BMW panniers, a rear grab bar, a rear cargo rack, folding passenger foot pegs, and both center and side stands.",
      "Wire-spoke wheels with Akront rims measuring 21″ up front and 17″ out back are mounted with Metzeler tires that have production-date codes from 2018 and 2019. Suspension consists of a telescopic fork with yellow-finished lowers and black accordion gaiters as well as a monoshock fitted to the Paralever single-sided swingarm. Braking is handled by a single Brembo caliper mounted over a cross-drilled disc up front and a drum out back. The brake fluid was flushed in April 2023.",
      "The cross-braced handlebar is equipped with black hand guards and a pair of round mirrors, and it sits aft of MotoMeter instrumentation that consists of a tachometer with a 7k-rpm redline as well as a 120-mph speedometer, and a central array of indicator lights. The five-digit odometer shows 19k miles, approximately 1k of which were ridden by the seller.",
      "The air-cooled 980cc OHV opposed twin features dual Bing carburetors, a two-into-one high-mount exhaust system, two valves per cylinder, an oil cooler, and an electric starter. Factory-rated output was 60 horsepower and 55 lb-ft of torque. Work in April 2023 involved changing the oil, adjusting the timing, valves, and carburetor floats, and replacing the carburetor bowl gaskets and fuel filters. The seller notes an oil leak from the push rod seals.",
      "Power is routed to the rear wheel through a five-speed transmission and an enclosed driveshaft, both of which received a fluid change in April 2023.",
      "Two spare two-up seats and the removed clear windscreen are included in the sale along with a rider’s manual, a tool roll, a poster, and spare parts."

      "This Chevrolet Corvette coupe was converted for racing use over 25 years ago and acquired by the current owner in Oregon in 2016. The car is finished in red with NART-style livery over a race-prepped interior and is powered by a modified 427ci V8 paired with an M22 four-speed manual transmission and a 3.55:1 rear differential. Equipment includes Torq Thrust–style 15″ wheels, four-wheel disc brakes, a side-exit exhaust system, a front spoiler, removable roof panels, adjustable front coilovers, a fuel cell, an MSD ignition system, and a roll cage as well as a fire-suppression system, a Hurst shifter, and a Kirkey Racing seat with a four-point harness. A mechanical overhaul was carried out in 2017, and an inspection and a compression test were performed in preparation for the sale. This C3 race car was sold on BaT in October 2023 and subsequently relisted in November 2023, and is now offered again on dealer consignment in Oregon with racing logbooks, recent service records, spare parts, and a bill of sale.",
      "The body was modified under previous ownership over 25 years ago in the style of the 1968 L88 RED/NART car that competed in the 1973 24 Hours of Le Mans. Equipment includes custom fixed headlight covers and grilles, removable roof panels, a custom side mirror, a side-exit exhaust system, a lower front spoiler, and front and rear tow loops.",
      "White-finished Torq Thrust-style 15″ alloy wheels feature polished lips and wear staggered-width Hoosier T.D. R racing tires. The aftermarket steering rack was rebuilt in 2018, and the rear leaf spring and U-joints were replaced. The front suspension features aftermarket control arms and adjustable coilovers, and braking is handled by four-wheel discs with SSBC Force 10 front calipers and custom air ducting.",
      "The removable hardtop conceals a full roll cage, and the driver is provided with a Kirkey high-back aluminum racing seat along with a Hurst shifter and a three-spoke steering wheel with a quick-release hub. Additional equipment includes a fire-suppression system, an electrical system master cut-off switch, an oversized mirror, and custom door panels.",
      "The custom dashboard houses an AutoMeter Phantom 10k-rpm tachometer and additional AutoMeter auxiliary gauges for fuel and oil pressure along with water temperature. Neither a speedometer nor odometer are installed, and the total chassis mileage is unknown.",
      "The 427ci V8 was rebuilt before being installed in 2018 and is equipped with a Dart Machinery block, 6.00″ lightweight connecting rods, a lightweight crankshaft, a custom oil pan, and a mechanical oil pump as well as Canfield cylinder heads, an Edelbrock intake manifold, a Holley carburetor, an MSD ignition system, an aluminum radiator with an electric fan, a fuel cell, and a custom exhaust system with Hooker headers. Compression test photos are provided in the gallery below.",
      "Power is routed to the rear wheels through a Muncie M22 four-speed manual transmission and a 3.55:1 rear differential that was rebuilt in June 2018. The clutch was replaced in August 2018.",
      "Vehicle log books are included in the sale along with literature and records.",
      "The race car is not legal for road use, has not been registered for the street, and carries no title or registration. It is being sold on a bill of sale."

It is finished in black with white pinstripes and is powered by an 898cc opposed twin paired with a five-speed transmission. Additional equipment includes an enclosed driveshaft, an electric starter, a rear cargo rack, an engine guard, dual Bing carburetors, 19″ front and 18″ rear wire-spoke wheels, a front disc brake, panniers, dual mirrors, an analog clock, and a black vinyl-upholstered two-up seat. This R90/6 is now offered with an owner’s manual, service records, spare parts, a tool kit, and a clean Texas title in the seller’s name.",
      "The bike was refinished in black during the 2015 refurbishment, and an LED headlight was fitted and the headlight harness replaced in April 2024. Equipment includes a left-side lift-assist handle, both center and side stands, panniers, dual mirrors, an analog clock, and a black vinyl-upholstered two-up seat. The seller notes a tear in the seat cover and a scratch on the engine guard.",
      "Wire-spoke wheels measure 19″ front and 18″ rear and are mounted with 3.25″ and 4.00 Continental tires, respectively. and stopping power is provided by a single front disc and a rear drum. Suspension consists of a leading-axle fork as well as dual Progressive Suspension shocks mounted to the swingarm on the left and the final-drive enclosure on the right. The fork seals were replaced and the front brake caliper rebuilt in February 2018, while a stainless-steel front brake hose and a replacement master cylinder were fitted in April 2024.",
      "The handlebar is mounted to the upper triple clamp via risers that frame an adjustment knob for the hydraulic steering damper. The dash panel houses a replacement MotoMeter 140-mph speedometer and a matching tachometer with a 7,100-rpm redline as well as indicator lights for brake failure, neutral gear selection, generator, oil pressure, and turn signals. The five-digit odometer shows 12k miles, though the seller has ridden over 90k miles. Total mileage is unknown.",
      "The 898cc opposed twin has been fitted with first-oversize pistons, a Keihan stainless-steel dual exhaust system with a crossover tube, and a Dyna electronic ignition system. The battery and air filter were replaced in April 2024 and the oil was changed at that time.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheel through a five-speed transmission and a driveshaft enclosed within the right leg of the swingarm. An easy-pull clutch device has been fitted.",
      "The number 4931968 stamped on the engine case matches with the numbers stamped on the frame and steering headstock tag, photos of which can be viewed in the gallery.",
      "A tool kit, an owner’s manual, a security cable, a repair manual, and records, are included in the sale."

Inside, the power-adjustable, heated, and ventilated front seats are accompanied by power-adjustable rear seats, Harman Kardon audio, navigation, a rear-seat entertainment system, and quad-zone automatic climate control. Work in 2024 consisted of flushing the brake fluid and replacing the front struts, brake rotors, and brake pads. Acquired by the selling dealer in June 2024, this Range Rover Supercharged has 73k miles and is now offered in California with owner’s manuals, floor mats, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Arizona title.",

      "This 1948 Chevrolet Fleetmaster station wagon was acquired by the current owner on BaT in May 2023 and was subsequently refurbished in a project that involved replacing rusted sheet metal, refinishing the bodywork in burgundy, refreshing the wood components, reupholstering the interior, and replacing the clutch. Equipment includes three rows of bench seating, a heater, a black vinyl roof covering, body-color 16″ wheels, hubcaps, whitewall tires, and a rear-mounted spare. Power is supplied by a 216.5ci inline-six paired with a column-shifted three-speed manual transmission. This Fleetmaster woodie wagon is now offered in Florida by the seller on behalf of the owner with refurbishment photos and a Montana title under the owner’s LLC.",
      "The steel body panels underwent rust repairs and other bodywork before being refinished in burgundy under current ownership, and the wood components were refurbished. Exterior details include a black vinyl roof covering, a split windshield, bumper overriders, a two-piece rear bumper, and a single taillight.",
      "Burgundy-painted 16″ steel wheels with trim rings and Chevrolet-stamped hubcaps are mounted with whitewall tires. A matching spare is attached to the drop-down tailgate.",
      "The three rows of bench seating have been retrimmed in tan upholstery, and the tan carpeting was replaced during the refurbishment. Appointments include a wooden roof, door panels, and pillars as well as an ashtray in the center of the dash and a Super Deluxe heater/defroster.",
      "A two-spoke steering wheel with a horn ring sits ahead of a 100-mph speedometer alongside rectangular auxiliary gauges. A clock is located on the opposite side of the dash. The five-digit odometer shows 24k miles, less than 10 of which have been added under current ownership; true mileage is unknown.",
      "The 216.5ci inline-six is fed by a replacement carburetor with a black air-cleaner assembly. The engine gaskets were reportedly replaced during the aforementioned refurbishment.",
      "Power is delivered to the rear wheels through a column-shifted three-speed manual transmission. The clutch was replaced during the refurbishment.",
      "Decoding the Fisher data plate reveals the following information:",

      "This 2001 BMW M5 was purchased by the current owner’s late husband in 2003, and it has remained registered in Florida since new. The car is powered by a 4.9-liter V8 paired with a six-speed manual transmission and is finished in Silverstone Metallic over Silverstone and black Nappa leather upholstery. Equipment includes 18″ Style 65 wheels, a limited-slip differential, a sunroof, xenon headlights, fog lights, heated power-adjustable front seats, dual-zone automatic climate control, and navigation. Work performed in 2023 included servicing the VANOS system and replacing the timing chain and guides, valve cover gaskets, water pump, thermostat, power steering hoses, oil pan gasket, spark plugs, drive belts, engine mounts, transmission mount, differential mount, oxygen sensor, and differential seals. This E39 M5 is offered by the seller on behalf of the current owner service records, manufacturer’s literature, and a clean Florida title in the owner’s name.",
      "The car is finished in Silverstone Metallic (425) with Shadowline trim and features aftermarket DjAuto xenon headlights with washers, fog lamps, rear parking sensors, a glass sunroof, a trunk lid spoiler, rain-sensing wipers, and quad exhaust outlets. A June 2024 entry on the Carfax report lists “minor damage” to the front of the car, which the seller attributes to the replacement of the front bumper cover. There is a ding in the right rear quarter panel, cracking on the door molding, and corrosion near the fuel filler cover.

      "This 1969 Morgan 4/4 is a right-hand-drive example that was imported to the US in 1982 by an American citizen who acquired the car while living in London. It was relocated to Texas under prior ownership and was acquired by the seller in 2024. Power is provided by a 1.6-liter inline-four that is equipped with a Weber carburetor and backed by a four-speed manual transmission. Work in preparation for the sale involved cleaning the carburetor, performing electrical repairs, refurbishing the distributor and fuel pump, and replacing the battery, water pump, and thermostat. Finished in cream over black upholstery, the car is equipped with a black tonneau cover, 15″ wire-spoke wheels, front disc brakes, a badge bar, a luggage rack, a wood-rimmed steering wheel, and a wood dashboard. This 4/4 is now offered at no reserve with an uninstalled soft top, side curtains, and a Texas title in the seller’s name.",
      "The car is finished in cream and equipped with a front badge bar, a rear luggage rack, wind wings, fender-mounted mirrors, and chrome bumpers. An uninstalled black soft top will accompany the car along with a matching tonneau cover and top boot. Areas of corrosion and touched-up paint are noted, and the wood in the sills is deteriorating.",
      "Wire-spoke 15″ wheels are secured with Morgan-branded knock-offs and are wrapped in bias-ply tires, which the seller states need to be replaced. A spare is mounted out back. Stopping power is provided by front disc and rear drum brakes.",
      "The right-hand-drive cockpit houses a pair of front bucket seats and a rear bench trimmed in black. Wear on the upholstery is shown in the gallery below. A storage cubby is located on the left side of the wood dash panel. The heater has been removed, and components will accompany the car.",
      "The wood-rimmed steering wheel sits ahead of a 110-mph speedometer, an 8k-rpm tachometer, and auxiliary readouts. The seller states that the tachometer reads higher than the actual rpm and that some gauges are inaccurate. The five-digit odometer shows 94k miles, approximately 150 of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The 1.6-liter inline-four is equipped with a Weber Brevettato 32 DFM carburetor and a K&N air cleaner assembly. Service in preparation for the sale reportedly involved changing fluids, cleaning the carburetor, adjusting the valves, repairing electrical components, refurbishing the distributor and fuel pump, and replacing the battery, water pump, and thermostat.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a four-speed manual transmission. The seller notes that the differential oil was changed and the clutch hydraulics were rebuilt in preparation for the sale.",
      "Documentation, partial service records, an uninstalled soft top, and side curtains will accompany the car."

      "This 1979 Porsche 928 is said to have spent time in storage from 2004 to 2017 before being acquired in 2019 by Casey Putsch of Genius Garage Racing, who initiated a refurbishment that involved an interior re-trim and mechanical work. It was purchased by the current owner in 2022, and subsequent work performed included repairing the instrument cluster and servicing the air conditioning system as well as replacing the power steering pump, thermostat, and various brake and clutch components. The car is finished in black metallic over black leatherette with Pasha velour inserts and is powered by a 4.5-liter V8 paired with a five-speed manual transaxle. Further equipment includes 16″ phone-dial alloy wheels, pop-up headlights, fog lights, cruise control, and a push-button AM/FM stereo. This 928 is now offered on dealer consignment in Michigan with an owner’s manual, partial service records, and a Nevada title.",
      "Finished from the factory Black Metallic (708), the car was repainted under prior ownership. Details include pop-up headlights with washers in addition to fog lights, power-adjustable mirrors, a locking fuel filler cap, and a rear window wiper. The taillights were refurbished and the left headlight bulb was replaced under current ownership. Various seals and trim pieces are recommended to be replaced.",
      "The 16″ phone-dial alloy wheels are mounted with 225/50 Continental Extreme Contact Sport tires with 2017 date codes. Braking is handled by power-assisted discs at each corner with red-finished calipers fitted up front. The power steering pump and brake pads and rotors were replaced, the brake master cylinder and booster were rebuilt, and the brake hard lines were refurbished under current ownership. The selling dealer recommends replacing the wheel center caps.",
      "The front bucket seats and folding rear seats are upholstered in black leatherette with replacement Pasha velour inserts, which extend to portions of the door panels. A replacement dash cap was retrofitted, and further appointments include air conditioning, cruise control, an analog clock, and a push-button AM/FM stereo. Work performed since 2022 has reportedly involved refurbishing the radio, replacing the ignition cylinder, repairing the climate control panel, and installing a rear-view mirror.",
      "The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a 170-mph speedometer, a 7,600-rpm tachometer, and auxiliary gauges for coolant temperature, fuel level, oil pressure, and voltage. The six-digit odometer shows 33k miles, approximately 200 of which have been added under current ownership. The instrument cluster was repaired and calibrated by North Hollywood Speedometer in California under current ownership. True mileage is unknown.",
      "The 4.5-liter V8 was factory rated at 219 horsepower and 254 lb-ft of torque. The water pump and timing components were replaced in 2017, and work performed since 2022 involved refurbishing the air conditioning system in addition to replacing the battery, thermostat, air intake hoses, and an alternator cable. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a rear-mounted five-speed manual transaxle. The transmission fluid was changed, the master cylinder, clutch release and pilot bearings were replaced, the flywheel was machined, and the right axle was rebuilt under current ownership.",
      "Additional underside photos are provided in the gallery below.",
      "An owner’s manual and partial service records are included in the sale."

      "This 2004 Mazda Mazdaspeed MX-5 Miata has 63k miles following registration history in Florida, Arizona, and California, and it was purchased by the seller from the late original owner’s family in July 2020. Modifications include a Flyin’ Miata cat-back exhaust system, a Hard Dog roll bar, a short-throw shifter, an aftermarket shift knob, and revised differential gearing. The car is finished in Titanium Gray Metallic over black and red cloth upholstery, and it is powered by a turbocharged 1.8-liter inline-four paired with a six-speed manual transmission. Additional equipment includes 17″ Racing Hart alloy wheels, Bilstein dampers, a black soft top, fog lights, a decklid spoiler, a leather-wrapped Nardi steering wheel, a Bose sound system, and air conditioning. This Mazdaspeed NB Miata is now offered at no reserve with service records and a clean California title in the seller’s name.",
      "This example is finished in Titanium Gray Metallic and features a black soft top, a heated glass rear window, fog lights, a front air dam, extended rocker panel trim, a power antenna, and painted mirror caps. Mazdaspeed-specific features include revised front and rear bumper covers, front and rear under spoilers, a color-matched rear lip spoiler, and Mazdaspeed badging. A Hard Dog roll bar has been added. The Carfax report indicates that a January 2010 accident resulted in damage to the front. The passenger-side mirror is loose, and close-up photos in the gallery detail cracks on the soft top, a dent on the front bumper cover, and finish imperfections on the body.",
      "Silver 17″ Racing Hart alloy wheels were reportedly powdercoated in March 2024 and are mounted with Kuhmo Ecsta tires. Stopping power is provided by four-wheel disc brakes with ABS, and the factory-lowered suspension features Mazdaspeed-tuned sway bars, springs, and Bilstein dampers.",
      "The cabin features bucket seats trimmed in black and red cloth along with color-coordinated door panels. Amenities include air conditioning, a Bose sound system, a CD stereo, power windows, a short-throw shifter, and an aftermarket shift knob.",
      "The leather-wrapped Nardi steering wheel frames a 150-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 6,500-rpm redline as well as gauges for oil pressure, coolant temperature, and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 63k miles, approximately 8k of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The turbocharged 1.8-liter inline-four was factory rated at 178 horsepower and 166 lb-ft of torque. A Flyin’ Miata cat-back exhaust system has been added, and the catalytic converter has been replaced. Work in March 2020 included replacing the timing belt, water pump, valve cover gasket, thermostat, front crankshaft seal, and camshaft seals. MAP and knock sensors were replaced in April 2022.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential, the latter of which was fitted with 3.6:1 gearing in February 2021.",
      "The Carfax report shows the aforementioned accident.",
      "The car most recently passed a California emissions test in June 2024."

      "This 1977 Alfa Romeo Alfetta was reportedly sold new in California, and refurbishment work carried out between 2006 and 2017 consisted of repainting the Olandese Blu exterior, refreshing the matching interior, and rebuilding the SPICA fuel injection in addition to sorting the electrical system and removing emissions-control equipment. Tubular exhaust headers, custom steel bumpers, and 15″ Rota wheels have been fitted along with a vintage-style digital radio, aftermarket air conditioning, and a 1975-specification grille. Powered by a 2.0L twin-cam inline-four paired with a five-speed manual transaxle, the car is further equipped with four-wheel disc brakes, polyurethane suspension bushings, and a woodgrain steering wheel and interior trim. Purchased by its current owner on BaT in October 2017, this Alfetta is now offered at no reserve by the seller on behalf of the owner with the removed heater and wheels as well as a clean Illinois title in the owner’s name.",
      "The car was factory-finished in Olandese Blu (343) and repainted in 2006. Modified 1967 Camaro bumpers have been fitted, as have a 1975-specification Alfetta front grille and headlight assemblies. Additional exterior details include dual side mirrors, a Centro Stile fender badge, C-pillar vents, and a downturned exhaust outlet. Bubbled paint near the left front wheel arch is noted by the seller, and photos showing pitted door-handle chrome, chipped paint, and other blemishes in the finish are provided in the gallery below.",
      "Rota 15″ alloy wheels with Alfa Romeo-logo center caps are wrapped in 205/60 Sumitomo HTR A/S P01 tires, and the suspension was rebuilt with polyurethane bushings under prior ownership. Braking is provided by four-wheel discs with inboard rears, and the system is said to have been serviced within the last year.",
      "The interior was reportedly refreshed in the mid-2010s, and the replacement front bucket seats and rear bench are upholstered in blue cloth. Matching door panels were fitted, and additional appointments include woodgrain trim, a vintage-styled digital radio, and three-point seatbelts as well as aftermarket air conditioning in place of the stock heater. Faded carpet and a loose radio fit are noted by the seller, and a cracked dashboard is depicted in the gallery.",
      "The replacement three-spoke steering wheel frames a refurbished 140-mph speedometer and 7,500-rpm tachometer along with a clock and gauges for fuel level, oil pressure, and coolant temperature. The five-digit odometer shows 33k miles and has reportedly rolled over, with approximately 600 miles added under current ownership. Total mileage is unknown.",
      "The 2.0-liter inline-four is equipped with a SPICA fuel-injection system that was rebuilt circa 2006. Tubular exhaust headers have been installed, all emissions-control equipment has been removed, and the car’s electrical system was sorted in 2017.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a rear-mounted, five-speed manual transaxle. The clutch was replaced circa 2006, the underside of the car is said to have been treated with Formula 3000 rust inhibitor in the mid-2010s, and the exhaust system and driveshaft flex joints were reportedly replaced under current ownership.",
      "The removed wheels and heater assembly are included in the sale."

      "This 1969 Chevrolet Camaro SS convertible was purchased in Ontario by the seller in circa 2011, and a subsequent refurbishment in 2015 included a repaint in Butternut Yellow and reupholstering the interior in vinyl and houndstooth cloth upholstery. It is powered by a replacement 396ci Turbo-Jet V8 paired with a four-speed manual transmission. Features include a 2.73:1 Positraction differential, a replacement black convertible soft top, 14″ steel wheels with hubcaps, power-assisted steering, retractable headlights, an Enduro-style front bumper, an AM/FM radio, Deluxe interior trim, power windows, and a cabin heater. This Camaro SS convertible is now offered in Canada with transferable Ontario registration in the seller’s name.",
      "The body is said to have been removed from the frame and refinished in Butternut Yellow during the refurbishment approximately a decade ago. An Endura-style front bumper has been added, while additional exterior details include a replacement black convertible soft top, retractable headlights, and chrome trim.",
      "The body-color 14″ steel wheels wear hubcaps and are mounted with 215/70 Goodyear Polyglas tires. The car is equipped with power steering, and braking is handled by power-assisted front discs and rear drums.",
      "The cabin features front bucket seats and a rear bench reupholstered in black vinyl with houndstooth inserts. Power windows have been retrofitted, and the car was optioned from the factory with Deluxe interior trim. Interior appointments include an AM/FM radio, woodgrain dashboard accents, and a cabin heater.",
      "The three-spoke steering wheel sits ahead of a 120-mph speedometer, a tachometer, and a fuel-level gauge. The five-digit odometer shows 31k miles, approximately 300 of which were added by the seller. Total mileage is unknown.",
      "The car was originally optioned with the L35-code 396ci Turbo Jet V8 rated at 325 horsepower and equipped with a four-barrel carburetor. The replacement 396ci Turbo-Jet L35 V8 was installed in 2010 per the seller.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a four-speed manual transmission and an optional 2.73:1 Positraction differential.",
      "Decoding the Fisher body tag reveals the following information:",
      "The car does not have a title, as it is registered in a country that does not issue vehicle titles. It is being sold on its Ontario provincial registration."

Equipment includes a brown convertible top, a removable hardtop, 14″ Bundt alloy wheels, and a heater. The selling dealer acquired the car in 2023, and it had previously been registered with the same owner since 1990. Work since October 2023 has reportedly included refinishing the wood trim as well as replacing the carpets and tires. This W113 SL is now offered at no reserve with a clean California title.",
      "The W113 SL was designed by Friedrich Geiger, Béla Barényi, and Paul Bracq and was introduced to the public at the 1963 Geneva Motor Show. This example is finished in Light Ivory (670) and features a brown soft top, a removable hardtop, a driver-side mirror, and European-specification headlights.",

      "The cabin houses bucket seats upholstered in Bamboo MB-Tex that extends to the door panels. The seller states that the wood trim was refinished in April 2024, the door panels have been redyed, and the carpets were replaced in preparation for the sale. Interior appointments include an analog clock, a floor-mounted gear shifter, a Kenwood cassette stereo, and a heater. Wear is present on the steering wheel and trim.",
      "The two-spoke steering wheel features a chrome horn ring and frames a 140-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 6,500-rpm redline as well as gauges for fuel level, oil pressure, and coolant temperature. The five-digit odometer shows 73k miles, a handful of which were added under current ownership. Total mileage is unknown.",
      "The 2.8-liter inline-six was installed in place of the original 2.3-liter unit under previous ownership.",

      "This 1937 Buick Series 80 Roadmaster is a Model 81 trunk-back sedan that underwent a cosmetic refurbishment under previous ownership that included a repaint in metallic gray as well as the installation of replacement tan cloth upholstery. Power comes from a 320ci straight-eight paired with a three-speed manual transmission, and equipment includes dual side-mount spare wheels, yellow-lens driving lamps, rear-hinged rear doors, an AM radio, a heater, a rear footrest, and a robe cord. An oil change was performed in preparation for the sale. This Series 80 Roadmaster was purchased by the selling dealer in 2024 and is now offered with a clean Massachusetts title.",
      "The Buick lineup was restyled for 1937 and featured squared-off fender ends, a split grille with horizontal chrome bars, and streamlined headlight buckets and fender-mounted driving lamps. A total of 14,637 Model 81 trunk-back sedans were produced for the model year. This example was delivered from the factory in Imperial Black (500) and was repainted in metallic gray under previous ownership. Equipment includes yellow-lens driving lamps, Roadmaster-branded hood vents, an antenna, dual side-view mirrors, running boards, dual taillights, and a glass-lens Buco-Buick brake lamp mounted on the trunk lid.",
      "The red-painted wheels feature chrome hubcaps and trim rings, and they are mounted with 7.00-16 Lester whitewall bias-ply tires. Spare wheels in body-color covers are stowed in the front fenders. The Model 81 rode on a 131″ wheelbase and featured a coil-sprung independent front suspension along with a live rear axle with leaf springs. Stopping power is provided by hydraulic drums at all four corners.",
      "The cabin was reupholstered in tan cloth under previous ownership, and it features front and rear benches along with a color-coordinated headliner, door panels, and carpets. Additional equipment includes an AM radio, a heater, a locking glovebox door with an inset clock, woodgrain dash and window trim, a rear cabin footrest, a robe cord, and a rear fold-down armrest.",
      "The three-spoke banjo-style steering wheel features a chrome horn ring, and it frames a 120-mph speedometer and auxiliary gauges. The five-digit odometer shows 49k miles, approximately 100 of which were added by the selling dealer. Total mileage is unknown.",
      "The 320ci straight-eight features five main bearings and a Carter carburetor for a factory rating of 130 horsepower. An oil change was performed in 2024.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels via a floor-shifted three-speed manual transmission."

      "This 1956 Austin-Healey BN2 Roadster is one of 640 factory-built 100M “Le Mans” specification cars produced between 1955 and 1956, and it is finished in Old English White and red with a black soft top over black leather. It was completed on October 13, 1955, as a North American-market example, and it was sold by B.C. Importers of Miami, Florida in October 1959 to a long-term owner of 39 years. The replacement 2,660cc inline-four was rebuilt in 2019 with an aluminum cylinder head from Denis Welch, forged 8.5:1-compression Arias pistons, a ground and re-hardened camshaft from Elgin, and a high-volume oil pump. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a four-speed manual transmission with overdrive. The car was listed on BaT in March 2020 and January 2021. Work performed since November 2022 included rebuilding the carburetors as well as replacing the clutch, resealing the front of the transmission, and replacing the pinion gear, oil pan, rear main seal, timing and valve cover gaskets, and ignition components, after which the car was listed on BaT in May 2024. This 100M is now offered in Arizona by the selling dealer with a 100M “Le Mans” Registry Certificate of Membership, a British Motor Industry Heritage Trust certificate, a 1959 sales invoice, service records, and a clean Michigan title.",
      "The car was refinished in Old English White with contrasting red lower bodywork during previous ownership, and replacement bumpers and overriders have been installed. The 100M-specific louvered hood is secured with a leather strap, and additional details include a black soft top, a tilt-down windshield, early-style smooth rear fenders, and replacement chrome bumpers with overriders. Close-up photos of the trim and finish are provided in the gallery, and a semi-circular crack on the shroud aft of the cockpit is noted.",
      "Silver-finished 15″ wire wheels are secured by two-eared knockoffs and wear 165-series Vredestein Sprint Classic tires. A matching spare wheel with a Dunlop SP 4N tire is secured in the trunk. Braking is handled by four-wheel drums, and the suspension and brakes were overhauled in 2018.",
      "The two-place cockpit features black leather upholstery with red piping over the seats and driveline tunnel that is complemented by red carpeting, door panels, and trunk lining. Additional features include a banjo-spoke steering wheel, a dashboard-mounted rear-view mirror, Sisal floor mats, and a 100M registry placard affixed to the body-color dashboard.",
      "Smiths instrumentation includes a 120-mph speedometer, a 6k-rpm tachometer, a fuel gauge, and a combination oil pressure and water-temperature gauge. The five-digit odometer shows 63k miles.",
      "The 2,660cc inline-four features a replacement block that was sleeved, line-bored, and hot-tanked during the 2019 rebuild. An aluminum cylinder head and uprated bolts from Denis Welch were fitted, and the factory pistons were replaced with forged alloy versions from Arias with an 8.5:1 compression ratio. The camshaft is a reground and re-hardened Elgin component made to 6707 M specifications, and the rotating assembly is said to have been balanced during the build. Markings on the twin SU carburetors and distributor are pictured in the previous listing for the car along with a summary document of the engine rebuild. Work performed since November 2022 consisted of rebuilding the carburetors, a valve adjustment, installing an aluminum oil pan, and replacing the rear main seal, timing and valve cover gaskets, heater hoses, two freeze plugs, and the ignition points, rotor, condenser, and wires.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels via a four-speed manual transmission with an electrically actuated overdrive unit. The floors were reportedly replaced under previous ownership and dents are pictured at various points along the frame rails. Work performed between November 2022 and January 2023 included resealing the front of the transmission, repairing overdrive shaft leaks, and replacing the clutch disc, pressure plate, pilot bushing, release bearing, and pinion gear.",
      "The 100M “Le Mans” Registry Certificate of Membership was issued in September 2019 and lists the chassis, engine, and body numbers. Additional documentation includes a British Motor Industry Heritage Trust certificate, 1959 invoices, 100M “Le Mans” articles, and recent service invoices."

      "This 1993 Ferrari 512 TR is one of 408 examples delivered to North America between 1992 and 1994. It was purchased by its current owner in July 2007, and it shows 39k miles following registration history in Oregon and California. Finished in Rosso Corsa over Beige Connolly leather, the car is powered by a 4.9-liter flat-12 paired with a five-speed manual transaxle. Equipment includes a limited-slip differential, a Tubi Style exhaust system, Fabspeed high-flow catalytic converters, 18″ five-spoke alloy wheels, pop-up headlights, air conditioning, power windows, a CD stereo, and a gated shifter. This 512 TR is now offered on dealer consignment with the owner’s manual, service records, awards, a car cover, spare parts, a clean Carfax report, and a clean California title.",
      "The Pininfarina-designed 512 TR was introduced as the updated successor to the Testarossa in 1991, with revisions that included restyled bumper covers as well as revised wheels and lighting. This example is finished in Rosso Corsa and features pop-up headlights, side intake strakes, body-color rocker panels, and quad exhaust outlets. Euro-style fog lights have been added.",
      "Silver 18″ five-spoke alloy wheels are mounted with Kumho Ecsta MX tires. Cross-drilled brake rotors are stationed at all four corners. The brake fluid was flushed in March 2024. The sale includes a spare set of 18″ Y-spoke wheels, and they are shod with Michelin tires.",
      "The cockpit is trimmed in beige Connolly leather upholstery over the seats, door panels, and lower dashboard. Interior amenities include a CD stereo, motorized seat belts, and a gated shifter located on the center console alongside controls for the air conditioning and power windows.",
      "The three-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel frames Veglia instrumentation including a 200-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 7,200-rpm redline as well as gauges for oil pressure and coolant temperature. A clock and auxiliary gauges for fuel level and oil temperature are housed in the center stack. The six-digit odometer shows 39k miles, approximately 21k of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The 4.9-liter DOHC flat-12 received updates over the version used in the Testarossa including Nikasil cylinder liners, a redesigned intake system, and Bosch engine management. Output was rated at 421 horsepower and 362 lb-ft of torque when new. A Tubi Style exhaust system and Fabspeed high-flow catalytic converters have been added. A belt service was reportedly performed in April 2021, and the oil and coolant were changed in March 2024.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a five-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. The transaxle fluid was changed in March 2024.",
      "The car won a Ferrari Club of America Premio di Platino award in 2015. The sale includes the spare set of 18″ Y-spoke wheels as well as awards, removed factory muffler and catalytic converter components, Schedoni luggage, a car cover, and service records.",
      "The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage.",
      "The car most recently passed a California emissions test in May 2021, however, the catalytic converters installed are not CARB-compliant."

      "This 1962 Century Resorter is a 17′ mahogany-hulled runabout that is powered by a replacement inboard 400ci GM V8 mated to a jet drive. The boat was purchased in 1982 by the seller’s father, who subsequently performed a refurbishment that included replacing the engine, rebuilding the Buehler jet drive, reupholstering the interior in red and white vinyl, and applying a West System epoxy overlay to the bottom. The boat features a two-piece windshield, a spotlight, a transom-mounted stepping board, running lights, and deck-mounted cleats. This Resorter is now offered at no reserve by the seller on behalf of his father’s estate with a single-axle trailer, a boat cover, spare parts, and Minnesota registrations for the boat and trailer.",
      "Work carried out on the 17′ mahogany hull included replacing damaged boards, applying a West System overlay, and stripping and reapplying the topside varnish and bottom paint. The boat is equipped with running lights, a spotlight, a two-piece windshield, and gunwale-mounted step plates.",
      "The cabin features two rows of bench seats that were reupholstered in red and white vinyl under current ownership. Appointments include a replacement gray carpet, a dash-mounted rearview mirror, a fire extinguisher, and storage cubbies to port and starboard.",
      "A four-spoke steering wheel fronts an upholstered dash that houses instrumentation consisting of a tachometer and gauges for engine temperature, oil pressure, and battery amperage. An aftermarket speedometer has been fitted to the left of the steering wheel. The hour meter shows 833 hours, though total runtime is unknown due to the replacement engine. The fuel level gauge is not functional.",
      "The replacement 400ci GM V8 was installed under current ownership in 1989. The fuel tank was flushed in preparation for the sale.",
      "The boat is equipped with a Buehler jet drive. The seller notes that there is a leak where the jet drive mounts to the boat.",
      "The single-axle trailer is equipped with a rolling tongue jack, a manual winch, rollers, carpeted bunks, surge brakes, and street lighting.",
      "The seller cannot locate a hull identification number on the boat, and one is not listed on the registration.",
      "The boat and trailer do not have titles as they are registered in a state that does not require a title for vehicles of their type. They are being sold on their registrations."

      "This 2006 Subaru Legacy GT Limited was purchased new by the seller from Manchester Subaru in Bedford, New Hampshire, and was subsequently brought to Canada and modified. It is powered by a turbocharged and intercooled 2.5-liter flat-four that is said to have been fitted with an AVO turbocharger, intercooler, and fuel pump as well as Deatschwerks fuel injectors, a COBB Tuning V2 Accessport, and aftermarket exhaust components. Power is delivered to all four wheels via a five-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip rear differential, and the car is finished in Brilliant Silver Metallic over black leather. Additional equipment includes 17″ Rays alloy wheels, an aftermarket front grille, heated and power-adjustable front seats, dual-zone automatic climate control, a short-throw shifter, and a six-disc CD changer. This modified Legacy GT has 151k miles, and is now offered in Canada with service records, a collection of magazines, three keys, spare parts, a clean Carfax report, and New Brunswick registration in the seller’s name.",
      "The car is finished in Brilliant Silver Metallic (39D), and an aftermarket front grille has been installed. Additional details include a hood scoop, projector-style headlights, fog lights, and heated and power-adjustable side mirrors with integrated signal indicators. The seller notes that touch-up paint has been applied to blemishes on various body panels, and the right rear door handle was replaced and does not match the body color.",
      "Silver-finished 17″ Rays Gram Lights wheels are mounted with 215/45 Bridgestone Potenza RE980AS tires. Koni adjustable struts are said to be retrofitted, and braking is provided by discs at all four corners.",
      "The heated and power-adjustable front bucket seats are upholstered in black leather and are joined by silver-finished trim that accents the dashboard, center console, and door panels. A short-throw shifter is said to have been retrofitted, and appointments include dual-zone automatic climate control, cruise control, an auto-dimming rearview mirror with Homelink, and an in-dash six-disc CD changer linked with aftermarket speakers. Wear is evident on various interior surfaces.",
      "The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a 160-mph speedometer, a tachometer, and auxiliary gauges. Additional readouts for monitoring boost pressure, oil pressure, and oil temperature are mounted in the center stack. The digital odometer indicates 151k miles, all of which have been added under current ownership.",
      "The turbocharged and intercooled 2.5-liter flat-four has been reportedly modified with an AVO 380 turbocharger, top-mount intercooler, and fuel pump in addition to Deatschwerks 850cc fuel injectors. The car is equipped with a Lachute tune using a COBB Tuning V2 Accessport, and dynamometer test results can be viewed in the gallery below. The timing belt and tensioner were replaced in January 2020, and the seller notes that the check engine light illuminates intermittently.",

Refinished in gray over a black and red interior, the car also features a limited-slip differential, a replacement black soft top, 14″ OZ wheels, and an aftermarket cassette stereo. Service under current ownership is said to have involved converting the air conditioning system to utilize R134a refrigerant as well as replacing the timing belt, water pump, clutch, suspension components, and more as detailed below. This E30 convertible is offered at no reserve with a seller-provided maintenance log and a clean Pennsylvania title in the seller’s name.",
      "The car was repainted in gray in 2005, while a replacement black soft top was installed in 2018 and the windshield was replaced within the past year. Additional exterior details include a power antenna, body-color mirror caps, white pinstripes, and quadruple headlights. Photos show dents on the right-rear quarter panel and the doors.",
      "OZ 14″ alloy wheels are mounted with 195/70 Kumho Solus TA11 tires. The car is equipped with an independent suspension and power-assisted four-wheel disc brakes with ventilated front rotors. The seller states that the front wheel hub assemblies were replaced in 2019 along with the front struts and rear shock absorbers, while the front brake pads, coil springs, and spring insulators were changed in 2024.",
      "According to the seller, the black cloth-upholstered and heated Corbeau front bucket seats were fitted in 2018, at which time the air conditioning system was converted to utilize R134a refrigerant. The rear bench seat is trimmed in red and black, and color-coordinated trim is visible throughout the cabin. Appointments include an onboard computer, cruise control, and a Sony cassette stereo along with power windows, door locks, and mirrors. The seller notes that the driver-side door lock needs to be rebuilt but that the locking mechanisms for the vehicle work otherwise.",
      "The three-spoke steering wheel wears an aftermarket wrap and frames a 150-mph speedometer, a tachometer, and auxiliary gauges. The six-digit odometer shows 151k miles, though the seller does not believe it is accurate and the odometer gears were replaced in 2024. Total mileage is unknown.",
      "The 2.5-liter M20 inline-six features Bosch fuel injection and was factory rated at 168 horsepower and 164 lb-ft of torque. Maintenance under current ownership is said to have included installing a replacement oxygen sensor in 2014 and a replacement radiator in 2017, changing the ignition wires in 2018, and fitting replacement radiator hoses and rebuilding the stater motor in 2020, while service within the past year reportedly involved replacing the following components:",
      "The seller notes hesitation under acceleration when the engine is cold.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a replacement five-speed manual gearbox that was installed in 2010 as well as a factory-optional limited-slip differential. The seller states that the clutch, pressure plate, and throwout bearing were replaced in 2016, a replacement differential mount and rear subframe mounts were fitted in 2017, and the clutch slave cylinder was changed in 2020.",

This “styled” example is said to have been refinished in orange under prior ownership and has streamlined sheet metal compared to pre-1938 models. Details include a mesh grille, a silver exhaust stack, headlights, rear half fenders, and Allis-Chalmers graphics.",
      "The steel wheels are painted orange up front, while the rear wheels have silver rims with orange centers. They are mounted with 5.50-16″ Super Hi-Rib front and 12.4-28″ Armstrong Hi-Traction Lug rear tires. Braking is handled by independent rear drums, and the tractor is equipped with a narrow–track front axle. The seller notes leaks in the front axle assembly and rear hubs.",
      "The operator’s station features a steel seat suspended on a flat spring. Controls include a hand throttle, a transmission output shaft disconnect lever, a foot pedal for the engine clutch, a shifter, and dual levers for the individual rear brakes.",
      "The three-spoke steering wheel sits ahead of a body-color instrument panel that houses an ammeter, and a coolant temperature gauge is recessed within the engine cover. The tractor is not equipped with an hour meter, therefore total runtime is unknown.",
      "The gasoline-fueled 201ci inline-four sends power to the rear wheels through a four-speed manual transmission.",
      "The tractor is equipped with a pin hitch, a rear power take-off shaft, and a side-mounted accessory belt pulley."

      "This 1976 Porsche 911 is a RoW coupe that was acquired by the seller’s father in 1991, and it is powered by a 2.7-liter flat-six mated to a five-speed manual transaxle. The car is finished in Guards Red over black leatherette upholstery, and equipment includes 15″ cookie-cutter alloy wheels, fog lights, body-color bumpers, front bucket seats, air conditioning, and a heated rear window. The engine was rebuilt in 2014, while more recent work since 2023 involved replacing the tires, recharging the air conditioning system, and replacing the fuel pump and ignition components. This mid-year 911 is now offered by the seller on behalf of their father with service records and a clean Alabama title.",
      "The car was finished from the factory in Guards Red (027) and features US-spec headlight trim rings, fog lights, and body-color impact bumpers. The front windshield seal was replaced in 2024. There is a dent on the left rear quarter panel, the exterior passenger door handle is broken, and the left fog light needs replacement.",
      "The 15″ cookie-cutter alloy wheels were mounted with 205/60 BFGoodrich Advantage Control tires in 2023. A space-saver spare is stored in the front trunk. Stopping power is provided by four-wheel ventilated disc brakes.",
      "Black leatherette upholstery covers the front bucket seats, folding rear seats, and side panels. Appointments include opening rear-quarter windows, an analog clock, air conditioning, a heated rear window, an aftermarket shift knob, and a CD stereo. The air conditioning system was recharged with R134a refrigerant in 2023. The seller notes that the radio and speakers could use tuning.",
      "The three-spoke steering wheel sits ahead of VDO instrumentation that consists of a 150-mph speedometer, a centrally mounted tachometer, and gauges for fuel level, oil level, oil temperature, and oil pressure. The five-digit odometer is inoperative and shows 60k miles, with 100 miles of which are said to have been added since the 2014 engine rebuild. Total mileage is unknown. The fuel level gauge is not accurate.",
      "The 2.7-liter flat-six features Bosch K-Jetronic fuel injection and was rebuilt in 2014. The CDI ignition control box was replaced in 2015, the fuel pump and lines were replaced in 2023, and work in 2024 consisted of replacing the spark plugs, ignition wires, and distributor cap and rotor. The seller states that the car smokes after sitting for approximately a week, and the hood cannot stay up on its own. Replacement hood struts will accompany the car.",

      "This 1983 Honda V45 Interceptor is said to have remained with a single owner in California from new until the seller’s October 2022 acquisition. Finished in a white, blue, and red livery, the motorcycle is equipped with a liquid-cooled 748cc DOHC V4 mated to a five-speed transmission. Equipment includes a quarter fairing, a lower cowl, a tinted windscreen, a two-up seat, a TRAC anti-dive fork, dual two-into-two exhausts, chrome engine guards, triple disc brakes, staggered-diameter D.I.D alloy wheels, rear-set foot controls, and both side and center stands. Maintenance under current ownership is said to have involved replacing the battery and the carburetor crossover tubes as well as cleaning the four Keihin carburetors. This VF750F shows 9k miles and is offered at no reserve with an owner’s manual, a service manual, a tool kit, a period brochure, and a clean California title in the seller’s name.",
      "The bodywork is finished in a white, blue, and red livery and mounted over a silver-finished double-cradle boxed steel frame. Equipment includes a quarter fairing, a tinted windscreen, a two-up seat, rear-set foot controls, passenger grab handles, chrome engine guards, dual mirrors, folding passenger foot pegs, and both center and side stands as well as a 5.8-gallon fuel tank with a recessed integrated petcock control.",
      "Six-spoke ComCast alloy wheels measuring 16″ up front and 18″ out back are mounted with Dunlop tires. Suspension consists of a telescopic TRAC anti-dive fork in addition to a monoshock attached to the swingarm. The triple disc brakes feature twin-piston sliding calipers and slotted rotors.",
      "Black-finished clip-on handlebars are mounted above the upper triple clamp, and the instrument panel ahead houses a 150-mph speedometer, a tachometer with a 10,500-rpm redline, and gauges for coolant temperature and fuel level. The five-digit odometer shows 9k miles, approximately 20 of which were ridden by the seller.",
      "The liquid-cooled 748cc DOHC V4 is equipped with an electric starter, dual radiators, electric cooling fans, and twin two-into-one exhausts with megaphone-style mufflers. Factory-rated output was 86 horsepower and 46 lb-ft of torque. Maintenance in preparation for the sale reportedly included changing the oil, replacing the battery and the carburetor crossover tubes, and cleaning the four 30mm Keihin carburetors. Photos showing the condition of the camshaft lobes can be viewed in the gallery below.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheel through a hydraulically actuated clutch, a five-speed transmission, and a drive chain.",

Finished in Moss Green over green and tan leather upholstery, the truck is powered by a 5.2-liter V8 linked with a four-speed automatic transmission and a Quadra-Trac Full-Time 4WD transfer case. Equipment includes a power sunroof, a receiver hitch, 16″ alloy wheels, anti-lock brakes, air conditioning, cruise control, power accessories, an Infinity Gold speaker system, and a CD/cassette stereo. This Grand Cherokee is now offered at no reserve in Canada with the manufacturer’s literature, service records, a Canadian Carfax report, and a British Columbia registration.",
      "The Orvis trim package was created in partnership with the Vermont-based apparel and sporting goods company, and this example is finished in Moss Green with two-tone pinstripes along with Orvis and gold-tone badging. Exterior details include fog lights, dual power-adjustable mirrors, roof-rack crossbars, tinted rear windows, a rear window wiper, and a hitch receiver. The seller notes that the rear window wiper requires adjustment.",
      "Machined alloy 16″ wheels with green-finished accents are mounted with 225/70 General Altimax RT tires. Orvis Edition examples were equipped with the Up Country Suspension Group, which also added tow hooks and skid plates. Braking is provided by four-wheel discs with ABS. The seller notes that the brakes squeal intermittently and that the front bump stops have fallen out.",
      "The power-adjustable front seats as well as the split-folding rear bench are upholstered in Dark Green leather with Champagne trim and Roan Red piping. Woodgrain panels with Orvis branding accent the cabin, which is further appointed with automatic climate control, Orvis-branded carpeted floor mats, power windows and locks, an Infinity Gold speaker system, and a CD/cassette stereo. The seller notes that the right front power door lock does not work at times and the blower motor fan is loud when operating.",
      "The three-spoke steering wheel is equipped with cruise-control buttons and it frames a 120-mph speedometer, a 7k-rpm tachometer, and gauges for fuel level, voltage, oil pressure, and coolant temperature. The oil pressure gauge works intermittently. The digital odometer indicates 57k kilometers (~35k miles), approximately 170 of which were added under current ownership.

      "This 1927 Erskine Model 50 coupe was reportedly sold new in California, and it was purchased by the seller’s father and grandfather in 1966 before undergoing a refurbishment that was performed between 1979 and 2004. The car is finished in metallic blue over gray cloth upholstery, and power comes from a Continental 146ci inline-six paired with a three-speed manual transmission. Equipment includes an electric starter, four-wheel mechanical drum brakes, 20″ wood-spoke wheels, a spare rim, a Boyce MotoMeter radiator cap, wind wings, and a rumble seat. This Erskine Model 50 is now offered by the seller on behalf of his father with an owner’s manual, literature, and a clean California title in the seller’s father’s name that lists the car as a 1927 Studebaker.",
      "Studebaker Corporation president Albert Russel Erskine sought to develop a short-wheelbase, entry-level model to expand the company’s footprint in European markets. His eponymous marque was launched at the Grand Palais in Paris, France, in 1927, and featured coupe, sedan, and touring models with styling by Raymond Dietrich. Marketed as ” The Little Aristocrat,” Erskine models were offered through 1930, when the marque was absorbed by Studebaker. This example has been repainted blue and features front and rear bumpers, a Boyce MotoMeter radiator cap, running boards, wind wings, a black roof panel, and a single taillight. Imperfections in the finish are noted by the seller.",
      "The wood-spoke wheels feature body-color hubs and rims, and they are mounted with 4.75-5.00–20 Firestone bias-ply tires. A black-painted spare rim with a Pullmore tire is mounted out back. The Model 50 rode on a 108″ wheelbase and featured solid axles with semi-elliptical leaf springs. Stopping power is provided by four-wheel mechanical drum brakes.",
      "The cabin features a bench seat trimmed in gray cloth along with a color-matched headliner, door panels, and carpets.",
      "The wood-rimmed steering wheel fronts a painted steel dash housing a Stewart-Warner 75-mph barrel speedometer and gauges for amperage, oil pressure, fuel level, and coolant temperature. The five-digit odometer shows 66k miles, approximately 1k of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The rumble seat features matching gray cloth upholstery.",
      "The 146ci inline-six was built for Erskine by the Continental Motors Company, and it was factory rated at 40 horsepower. An electric starter was installed prior to 1966, and the ignition points and distributor were serviced in 2019.",
      "The car is titled by its engine number 8F13104.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels via a three-speed manual transmission."

      "This 2005 Chrysler Crossfire Limited Roadster has 40k miles following registration history in Pennsylvania. Finished in Blaze Red Crystal Pearl Coat over Dark Slate Gray leather, the car is powered by a 3.2-liter V6 paired with a six-speed manual transmission. Features include a black convertible soft top, staggered-diameter seven-spoke alloy wheels, a speed-activated rear spoiler, fog lights, heated power-adjustable seats, a Sony CD stereo, dual-zone climate control, and cruise control. This Crossfire is now offered in Florida by the selling dealer at no reserve with the owner’s manual and a Pennsylvania title.",
      "The Crossfire shared its platform with the Mercedes-Benz R170 SLK, and this example is finished in Blaze Red Crystal Pearl Coat. It is equipped with a power-operated black soft top that stows beneath a body-color top boot. Additional exterior details include a speed-activated rear spoiler, projector headlights, fog lights, heated power-adjustable side mirrors, a straked hood, fender vents, and dual center exhaust outlets. The Carfax report lists “minor damage” to the rear in a September 2018 entry, and the selling dealer indicates that the rear bumper cover was repainted under prior ownership. Photos showing paint-meter readings are included in the gallery.",
      "The 18″ and 19″ seven-spoke alloy wheels are mounted with Continental ExtremeContact DWS 06 tires. Stopping power is provided by four-wheel disc brakes. The car is equipped with a touring suspension, electronic stability control, and traction control.",
      "The cabin features heated power-adjustable seats trimmed in Dark Slate Gray leather, while silver-color trim accents the center stack. Amenities include a Sony CD stereo, dual-zone climate control, and cruise control.",
      "The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a 160-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 6k-rpm redline as well as gauges for fuel level and coolant temperature. The digital odometer indicates 40k miles.",
      "The SOHC 3.2-liter M112 V6 was sourced from Mercedes-Benz and was rated at 215 horsepower and 229 lb-ft of torque. The thermostat was replaced in December 2021, the air and cabin filters were replaced in July 2023, and the oil was changed in July 2024.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed manual transmission.",
      "The Carfax report shows the aforementioned damage."

      "This 1964 MGB Roadster was campaigned as an E/P racer in the Corinthian Vintage Auto Racing (CVAR) circuit from 1997 to 2020 and was acquired by the seller as a non-running project in 2022. The replacement 1.8-liter inline-four was installed under current ownership and features County pistons, a 719 camshaft, a Vernier cam gear, a mildly ported cylinder head, dual SU carburetors, and an LCB header. The car is finished in blue with white stripes and additional equipment includes a four-speed manual transmission, a modified suspension, front disc brakes, 14″ alloy wheels, Nitto NT-01 tires, a low-profile polycarbonate windshield, a roll cage, a fixed-back racing seat, a five-point harness, an electrical cut-off switch, and a fuel cell. This MGB is offered at no reserve with a 2024 CVAR log book and a clean Texas title in the seller’s name.",
      "The car is finished in blue with black accents and white over-the-top stripes and numbers. Exterior details include early-style “pull” door handles, front and rear tow points, deleted headlights, hood pins, a low-profile tinted polycarbonate windscreen, and a bullet-style driver mirror. Blemishes in the paint and repaired race damage are viewable in the gallery.",
      "Polished 14″ slotted aluminum wheels are mounted with 205/55 Nitto NT-01 tires that are recommended for competition use only. The suspension is modified with heavy-duty front springs, drop spindles, front and rear sway bars, and a Panhard bar. Braking is provided by front discs and rear drums.",
      "The stripped cockpit houses a single fixed-back racing seat upholstered in black vinyl and cloth. Appointments include a roll cage, a Speedway Motors five-point harness, a convex rearview mirror, and an electrical cut-off switch. The pictured fire extinguisher does not accompany the car.",
      "The steering wheel fronts an 8k-rpm tachometer and auxiliary gauges. The 120-mph speedometer and the five-digit odometer are disconnected and true mileage is unknown.",
      "The trunk houses a fuel cell, a Holley electric fuel pump, and the mechanism for the electrical cut-off switch.",
      "The replacement 1.8-liter inline-four was installed under current ownership. The cylinders are bored .020 over and the cylinder head received mild porting work, a three-angle valve job, and dual race valve springs. Additional features include County pistons, a 719 camshaft, a Vernier cam gear, twin SU carburetors, K&N air cleaners, and an LCB header. The seller states the compression is approximately 10:1 and conventional premium fuel can be used.",
      "Power is routed to the rear wheels through an aluminum flywheel, a four-speed manual transmission, and an open differential with 4.30:1 gearing."

      "This 1954 Sunbeam Alpine is powered by a 2,267cc inline-four paired with a floor-shifted four-speed manual transmission, and it underwent a cosmetic refurbishment circa 2004 that included a repaint in metallic gray over a reupholstered red leather interior. The car was purchased by the current owner in January 2020, and subsequent service has involved machining the cylinder head, rebuilding the generator and the heater box, repairing and polishing the beltline trim, and replacing the clutch assembly, water pump, voltage regulator, wheel cylinders, engine mounts, tachometer cable, and tires. Additional equipment includes a black convertible top, 16″ ventilated steel wheels, hubcaps, four-wheel drum brakes, independent front suspension, Lucas driving lamps, a spotlight, and a USB charger port. This Alpine Mk I is now offered on dealer consignment with service records from current ownership, detachable side windows, a tonneau cover, tire-changing tools, a can of paint, owner’s and workshop manuals, a parts catalog, Alpine literature, and a Pennsylvania title in the owner’s name.",
      "The hand-fabricated Mulliners body was refinished in metallic gray under previous ownership. Exterior details include chrome bumpers with overriders, amber-lens Lucas driving lamps, an 18″ badge bar, a louvered hood, fender-mounted dual side mirrors, and chrome external trunk hinges. The stainless-steel beltline trim was repaired and polished in May 2021. Paint cracks on the lower-left trunk lid are shown in the seller’s walk-around video provided below.",
      "Body-color 16″ ventilated steel wheels wearing chrome hubcaps with Sunbeam crests are mounted with Coker Classic tires showing 2018 date codes, and a spare is stowed in a hatch below the trunk. Suspension consists of independent coil springs up front, semi-elliptic leaf springs out back, and Armstrong lever-type shocks at all four corners. Stopping power is provided by twin leading-shoe finned drum brakes that had all six wheel cylinders replaced in August 2023.",
      "The car is fitted with a black canvas soft top. Detachable sliding side windows and a black canvas tonneau cover are included in the sale.",
      "The seats are trimmed in red leather that extends to the dash pad, door panels, center armrest, cockpit collar, and shifter boot. The tan carpeting is overlaid with brown and tan Coco-type mats. The heater box was rebuilt and repainted in May 2021, and additional interior details include a dash-mounted rearview mirror and a USB charger port that was installed in July 2020.",
      "The ivory-colored banjo-style steering wheel fronts an arching 120-mph AC speedometer set in a body-color dash and flanked by gauges for fuel level, coolant temperature, amperage, and oil pressure. A 6k-rpm AC tachometer is mounted centrally on the bottom edge of the dash. The five-digit odometer shows 11k miles, approximately 2k of which were added under current ownership. True mileage is unknown.",
      "The 2,267cc inline-four was rated at 80 horsepower when new and features a high-compression cylinder head that was resurfaced in July 2020. Additional equipment includes a downdraft carburetor, an Arthur Gould Rebuilders water pump, and replacement engine mounts. The generator was rebuilt in June 2024, and the oil was changed in preparation for the sale.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a replacement clutch and a four-speed manual transmission that was rebuilt in June 2023.",
      "In addition to the aforementioned detachable side windows and black canvas tonneau cover, the car is accompanied by the owner’s service records, a pint can of touch-up paint, tire-changing tools, owner’s and workshop manuals, a parts catalog, and additional Alpine literature.",
      "The Pennsylvania title carries an “Antique Vehicle” brand."

    "description": [
      "This 1980 Mercedes-Benz 500SL is a European-market example finished in Astral Silver Metallic that was imported to the US before it was acquired by the seller’s uncle in 1990. It is powered by a 5.0-liter M117 V8 mated to a four-speed automatic transmission and equipped with a color-keyed removable hardtop, a rear spoiler, 16″ RIAL basketweave alloy wheels, power windows, and heated front bucket seats upholstered in black leather as well as air conditioning, cruise control, and a Blaupunkt stereo. The seller’s parents acquired the car in 2023, and work since has included repairing the odometer and replacing the tires and battery. This Euro R107 is now offered by the seller on behalf of their parents with service records dating to 1991 and a clean California title.",
      "The car left the factory finished in Astral Silver Metallic and features a color-keyed removable hardtop as well as both front and rear spoilers. Additional exterior details include fog lights, dual side mirrors, a power antenna, and twin polished exhaust outlets. The car is not equipped with a soft top. The bottom edge of the front spoiler is damaged.",
      "Silver-finished RIAL 16″ basketweave alloy wheels were mounted with 225/50 Michelin Pilot Sport All Season tires in May 2024. Braking is handled by power-assisted four-wheel discs. The seller notes that the tie rods are loose.",
      "The heated front bucket seats and the two-place rear bench are trimmed in black leather, and they are joined by color-coordinated door panels and carpeting. A Blaupunkt Berlin SQR 83 head unit and speakers have been added, and the cabin is further appointed with air conditioning, cruise control, power windows, and wood trim pieces.",
      "The four-spoke steering wheel frames a tachometer with a 6k-rpm redline and an inset analog clock as well as a 160-mph speedometer and gauges for coolant temperature, oil pressure, fuel economy, and fuel level. The six-digit odometer shows 7k miles, approximately 200 miles were added by the current owner. The odometer had frozen under previous ownership and was repaired in April 2024, therefore true mileage is unknown.",
      "The 5.0-liter M117 SOHC V8 features Bosch K-Jetronic fuel injection and was modified to meet California emissions standards in 1991. Adjustments were made to the ignition system and the battery was replaced in March 2024. The air conditioning system was partially recharged and an oil change was most recently carried out in April 2024. A note from that service visit describes smoke at start-up and the presence of vacuum leaks.",
      "Power is delivered to the rear wheels through a four-speed automatic transmission."

The car is powered by a turbocharged 1.2-liter inline-four linked with a five-speed manual transaxle and finished in silver with red decals over blue and gray cloth. Equipment includes 13″ multi-spoke wheels with Volk Racing aero covers as well as air conditioning, a dashboard cooler, an Alpine AM radio, and a BOSS Bluetooth stereo. This City Turbo II is offered with a Pennsylvania title in the seller’s name.",

Additional exterior details include an asymmetric grille, yellow fog lights, side vents, window visors, and mud guards. Replacement decals were applied to the body and the right front fender received rust repairs and a repaint under previous ownership. Peeling paint is present on the mirror caps.",

The dashboard features a built-in cooler, and additional appointments include air conditioning, an Alpine AM radio, and a BOSS Audio Systems Bluetooth stereo. A hole is noted in the upholstery on the driver seat outer bolster.",
      "The three-spoke steering wheel fronts a tachometer with a 6k-rpm redline as well as a digital speedometer and turbo gauge and analog readouts for coolant temperature and fuel level. The five-digit odometer has rolled over and shows 311 kilometers (~193 miles). The seller notes that approximately 11k kilometers (~7k miles) were driven under current ownership. Total mileage is unknown.",
      "The turbocharged and intercooled 1.2-liter inline-four is equipped with multi-port fuel injection and was factory rated at 108 horsepower and 118 lb-ft of torque. The seller reports that an idle-hunting issue was resolved under current ownership. The oil was most recently changed in April 2024.",
      "Power is sent to the front wheels through a five-speed manual transaxle. The car is equipped with a straight-pipe exhaust.",

Equipment includes chromed 16″ alloy wheels, anti-lock disc brakes, a glass sunroof, automatic climate control, a factory cassette stereo, and power accessories. In December 2022, the oil was changed, the coolant was flushed, and the tires, front brake pads, and intake-manifold and valve-cover gaskets were replaced. This ES300 has 41k miles and is now offered at no reserve in Georgia with owner’s manuals, two keys, a clean Carfax report, and a Georgia title.",

The door panels are trimmed to match, and the cabin is further appointed with woodgrain trim, automatic climate control, power windows and locks, and a digital clock as well as a rear window defroster, cruise control, Lexus-branded carpeted floor mats, and a factory stereo with a cassette player.",
      "The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a 140-mph speedometer, an 8k-rpm tachometer, and gauges for fuel level and coolant temperature. The digital odometer indicates 41k miles, approximately 15 of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The four-cam 3.0-liter V6 is equipped with continuously variable valve timing and was factory rated at 210 horsepower and 220 lb-ft of torque. In December 2022, the oil was changed and the valve-cover and intake-manifold gaskets were replaced.",

      "This Ford T-bucket was built by Al Mathon of Hicksville, New York, and is powered by a 700ci V16 constructed from two Chevrolet small-block V8s. Breathing through two Holley four-barrel carburetors, the powerplant features a single crankshaft and is backed by an automatic transmission. The car is fitted with fiberglass bodywork and rides on a custom frame equipped with a tubular front axle, front disc brakes, and rear coilovers. Additional equipment includes a front wing, polished exhaust headers, Weld Racing 15” alloy wheels, a custom steering wheel, Stewart-Warner instrumentation, and black leather upholstery. Acquired several years ago by the Petersen Automotive Museum of Los Angeles, California, this V16-powered hot rod is now offered at no reserve with a California title.",
      "Al Mathon was a welder and instructor from Long Island who built this roadster and its engine with his son. The V16 was constructed by cutting and welding two 350ci Chevrolet V8 engine blocks back-to-front to form a single unit with nine main bearings. Cylinder heads were combined in a similar fashion, and each side features a finned valve cover emblazoned with “Mathon V16.” Two crankshafts were joined with a 45-degree offset into a single unit, as were two camshafts, so that each revolution delivers eight sequential power strokes. Induction is through dual Holley four-barrel carburetors, and two sets of exhaust headers run in parallel on each side, exiting in front of the rear wheels.",
      "The fiberglass body is finished in black, and it is mounted to a custom-fabricated tubular steel frame that has been painted to match. Exterior details include a front wing, a grille guard, and chrome headlight buckets. The seller notes that the mounting gasket for the right-side LED taillight is misaligned.",
      "Staggered-width Weld Racing 15” alloy wheels are mounted with 135-series Firestone F-560 tires up front and 33×21.5” Mickey Thompson Sportsman units out back. The tubular front axle features a transverse leaf spring and radius rods, while the live rear axle is equipped with adjustable coilovers. Braking is handled by vented discs up front and drums out back.",
      "The cockpit is trimmed in black leather with white accents, and black carpets line the floor. The dashboard fascia has been painted to match the body, and a Lokar shifter has been installed.",
      "The custom steering wheel is mounted to an Ididit tilting column, and Stewart-Warner instrumentation consists of a 160-mph speedometer, an 8k-rpm tachometer, and auxiliary gauges. The six-digit odometer shows 13 miles, and total mileage is unknown.",
      "The distributor was custom-fabricated and is connected to a Mallory HyFire ignition box. Dual electric fans are mounted to a polished radiator.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a three-speed automatic transmission. Corrosion is noted on the engine and underbody components, which can be viewed in the gallery.",
      "The car is titled in California as a 1923 Ford using the VIN T8765521."

      "This 2002 Chevrolet Corvette Z06 was acquired by the current owner in 2009 and now has 31k miles. The car is powered by a 5.7-liter LS6 V8 linked to a six-speed manual gearbox and a limited-slip differential. The car is finished in Quicksilver Metallic over Torch Red and black leather and is equipped with 17″ aftermarket wheels, the Memory Package, pop-up headlights, dual-zone climate control, cruise control, a head-up display, a power-adjustable driver’s seat, a Bose sound system, and a CD stereo. This C5 Z06 is now offered on dealer consignment at no reserve with a window sticker, the owner’s manual, service records, spare parts, an accident-free Carfax report, and a clean New York title.",
      "The C5 Z06 was only offered as a fixed-roof coupe for increased chassis stiffness and featured a quad-exit titanium exhaust system, mesh grille inserts, and weight-saving measures such as thinner glass and reduced sound deadening when compared to the standard C5. This example is finished in Quicksilver Metallic and features pop-up headlights, Z06 fender badges, and rear brake vents. Paint protection film was applied to the hood, door guards, and turn signals in 2013.",
      "The chrome-finished 17″ aftermarket wheels are mounted with 265/40 front and 295/35 rear Goodyear Eagle F1 tires. The Z06 suspension featured a larger front stabilizer bar, increased damping, and a higher spring rate than the standard Corvette. The car is equipped with active handling and traction control systems, speed-sensitive rack-and-pinion power steering, and ventilated disc brakes at all four corners. Replacement brake rotors and pads were installed within the past two years, and the removed factory wheels are included in the sale per the selling dealer.",
      "The cabin features two seats upholstered in Torch Red and black leather. Amenities include a six-way power-adjustable driver’s seat, a head-up display, dual-zone automatic climate control, an onboard computer, cruise control, electrochromic mirrors, and a Bose sound system with an in-dash CD player.",
      "The leather-wrapped steering wheel fronts a 200-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 6,500-rpm redline along with gauges for coolant temperature, oil pressure, voltage, and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 31k miles, approximately 2,200 of which were added under current ownership. A mileage inconsistency is noted in an April 2009 Carfax report entry.",
      "The 5.7-liter LS6 V8 was based upon the contemporary LS1 and features a refined aluminum block, a higher-lift camshaft, a 10.5:1 compression ratio, and increased air and oil flow. Factory-rated output for the 2002 model year was 405 horsepower and 400 lb-ft of torque. An oil change was performed in April 2024.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed manual gearbox and a limited-slip differential.",
      "The window sticker notes initial delivery to Planker Chevrolet of West Babylon, New York, and lists factory colors, options, and a total vehicle price of $51,535.",
      "The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage and lists the aforementioned mileage inconsistency.",

Additional features include 15″ wire-spoke wheels, front disc brakes, an AM/FM radio, flow-through ventilation, a heater, front bucket seats, and black leather upholstery. This 1800S is now offered in Rhode Island at no reserve by the seller on behalf of the owner with a clean North Carolina title in the owner’s name.",

Centrally mounted auxiliary readouts for fuel level and oil pressure are joined by an analog clock. The five-digit odometer does not work and currently shows 13k miles. Total mileage is unknown.",

      "This 1980 Jeep J-10 is a Sportside pickup that was acquired by the selling dealer in 2022 and subsequently fitted with Holley Sniper fuel injection. Additional work performed involved repainting the bumpers, overhauling the brakes, and replacing the body seals, power steering pump, battery, starter, transmission oil pan gasket, and various cooling components. The truck is finished in blue over blue cloth upholstery and is powered by a 258ci inline-six mated to a three-speed automatic transmission and a dual-range transfer case. Additional equipment includes 15″ steel wheels, 33″ tires, power steering, power-assisted front disc brakes, manually locking front hubs, and a bed-mounted roll bar in addition to air conditioning, a B&M shifter, and a Sony cassette stereo. This J10 pickup is now offered by the selling dealer in Georgia with an invoice for work performed under current ownership and a clean Texas title.",

Details include a Sportside bed, dual side mirrors, a sliding rear window, a bed-mounted roll bar, wood bed rails, and a receiver hitch. The front and rear bumpers were repainted under current ownership, at which time the window and door seals were replaced.",
      "White-finished 15″ steel wheels are mounted with 33×12.5″ Kenda Klevar A/T 2 tires. Multiple lug nuts are missing and the finish is failing on the wheels. The front axle is equipped with manually locking hubs, and braking is provided by power-assisted front discs and rear drums. Work performed under current ownership involved replacing the power steering pump, front brake pads and rotors, and rear brake wheel cylinders, shoes, and drums.",
      "The front bucket seats are upholstered in faded blue cloth and are joined by color-coordinated door panels. A B&M shifter and a Sony cassette stereo have been retrofitted, and air conditioning, a digital clock, a locking glove compartment, and a passenger grab handle are further details.",
      "The three-spoke steering wheel sits ahead of an engine-turned instrument bezel that consists of an 85-mph speedometer and auxiliary gauges for fuel level, coolant temperature, oil pressure, and amperage. A Holley EFI module is mounted to the left climate control duct. The five-digit odometer shows 57k miles, approximately 150 of which have been added by the selling dealer.",
      "The 258ci inline-six was fitted with Holley Sniper electronic fuel injection in 2024. Additional work performed involved replacing various coolant gaskets as well as the radiator, thermostat, starter, and battery.",
      "Power is sent to the rear or all four wheels through a three-speed automatic transmission and a dual-range transfer case. The transmission oil pan gasket was replaced in 2024."

      "This 1978 Bultaco Pursang 370 is said to have been raced in Southern California before being acquired in 2016 by the seller, who completed a refurbishment of the bike in 2024. Work at that time included overhauling the 363cc two-stroke single’s top end, repainting the frame and bodywork, reupholstering the seat, rebuilding the wheels and fork, and replacing the remote-reservoir shocks, wheel spokes, hand controls, drive chain, and sprockets. Equipment includes a five-speed transmission, a side stand, a cross-braced handlebar, yellow front and side number plates, drum brakes, and a high-mount exhaust system. This Mk11 Pursang 370 is now offered in Tennessee for off-road use only with refurbishment records and images, a Bell helmet, goggles, a riding jersey, a mouth guard, an owner’s manual, spare parts, and a bill of sale.",
      "The frame, swingarm, fiberglass bodywork, and accessories were stripped and repainted in blue with silver, red, and yellow accents during the refurbishment, and the seat was reupholstered, the fuel tank internally sealed, and the petcocks replaced at that time. Equipment includes high-mount fenders, a right-side side stand, yellow side and front number plates, and serrated foot pegs.",
      "The 21″ front and 18″ rear alloy rims were overhauled with new bearings, seals, and stainless-steel spokes and mounted with knobby tires during the refurbishment. The leading-axle fork was overhauled at that time, and a pair of reproduction remote-reservoir Betor shocks were fitted. The swingarm bushings, seals, and bolt were replaced. Braking is from drums at both ends.",
      "A black cross-braced handlebar is secured to the upper triple clamp, and the brake, clutch and throttle cables along with the Magura throttle, grips, and kill switch were replaced in 2024. The bike did not come with an odometer or other instrumentation, therefore total mileage is unknown. The seller estimates having ridden approximately 20 hours.",
      "The 363cc two-stroke single was factory rated at 41 horsepower and is equipped with a kick starter along with a high-exit expansion-chamber exhaust system. The bottom end was overhauled in 2016, and work during the 2024 refurbishment included rebuilding the top end and carburetor, replacing or zinc-coating hardware as needed, and replacing the seals, gaskets, o-rings, reed valves, intake spacer, air filter, and air filter housing.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheel through a five-speed transmission. The drive chain and sprockets were replaced during the refurbishment."

Modifications include a Ford Motorsport A231 camshaft and “big valve” cylinder head as well as a Super Turbo muffler, a Saleen G-bar, subframe connectors, urethane sway bar bushings, an 8.8″ rear axle with a Ford Motorsport 3.73:1 differential. Additional equipment includes 16″ alloy wheels, power-assisted four-wheel disc brakes, and a Clarion CD stereo. This Mustang SVO is now offered at no reserve in Washington state with the owner’s manual, service records, spare parts, and a clean Oregon title.",
      "Ford’s Special Vehicle Operations gave the Mustang SVO a biplane rear spoiler and revised front-end styling as well as thinner rocker panels and an offset hood scoop to feed the top-mount intercooler. This example was repainted in red under prior ownership and features fog lights, polished exhaust finishers, and black trim. Exterior blemishes are displayed in the gallery.",
      "The 16″ alloy wheels are mounted with older 225/50 Toyo Proxes tires. The SVO was equipped from the factory with power steering and adjustable Koni dampers. Modifications include subframe connectors, a Saleen G-bar, and urethane sway bar bushings. The car is equipped with power steering, and braking is handled by power-assisted four-wheel discs.",

Amenities include articulated front sport seats, a premium sound system, a Clarion CD stereo, a tilting steering column, a digital clock, intermittent wipers, power windows, and power locks. Interior blemishes are displayed in the gallery. The air conditioning does not work.",
      "The three-spoke sport steering wheel frames an 85-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 5,800-rpm redline as well as gauges for boost pressure, coolant temperature, oil pressure, and fuel level. The five-digit odometer shows 47k miles.",

This R27 is now offered at no reserve with manufacturer’s literature, service records, and a clean South Carolina title in the seller’s name.",

      "Rebuilt wire-spoke wheels with 18″ Excel alloy rims wear Avon RoadRider tires. Suspension is provided by an Earles fork as well as preload-adjustable shocks mounted to the swingarm on the left and the final-drive housing on the right. Braking is handled by front and rear drums.",
      "The chrome low-rise handlebar fronts a 90-mph speedometer and a pair of indicator lights. The five-digit odometer shows 2,100 miles, approximately 200 of which were ridden under current ownership. Total mileage is unknown.",
      "The 247cc vertical single is said to have been modified with an R50S piston and replacement valves under prior ownership. It features a Bing carburetor and was factory rated at 18 horsepower. The valves were adjusted, the cylinder head bolts torqued, and the fluids changed by the seller in July 2024.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheel through a four-speed transmission as well as a driveshaft enclosed within the right leg of the swingarm.",

      "This 1978 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am was refurbished under prior ownership and work consisted of repainting the body, retrimming the interior, and rebuilding the engine. Finished in Starlight Black over Carmine vinyl upholstery, the car is powered by a 400ci V8 linked with a three-speed automatic transmission and a Safe-T-Track limited-slip differential. The car has been fitted with an Edelbrock intake manifold and cylinder heads, Hedman exhaust headers, and a Hooker Aero Chamber muffler, and equipment includes a shaker hood, 15″ Cragar SS wheels, power steering, power front disc brakes, and an AM/FM radio. The selling dealer acquired the car in June 2024. This Firebird Trans Am is now offered with service records and a clean New York title.",
      "The car was repainted in Starlight Black circa 2018, and exterior equipment includes Firebird hood graphics on the shaker hood as well as a front spoiler, a rear spoiler, painted mirror caps, and polished quad exhaust outlets.",
      "The 15″ Cragar SS wheels are mounted with BFGoodrich Radial T/A white-letter tires measuring 245/60 up front and 255/60 out back. The vehicle is equipped with power steering, and stopping power is provided by power-assisted front discs and rear drums.",
      "The front bucket seats and rear bench were retrimmed in Carmine vinyl upholstery, which extends to the center console, door panels, and carpets. Amenities include an engine-turned dash fascia, a full-length center console, an AM/FM radio, and a heater.",
      "The leather-wrapped Formula steering wheel fronts a 100-mph speedometer, a 6k-rpm tachometer, an analog clock, and a fuel-level gauge. The five-digit odometer shows 85k miles, a handful of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The 400ci V8 was rebuilt in 2018 and is said to have been fitted with Butler Performance engine internals as well as Edelbrock Performer aluminum cylinder heads and Hedman exhaust headers.",
      "Power is routed to the rear wheels through a three-speed automatic transmission and a Safe-T-Track limited-slip differential. A Hooker Aero Chamber muffler has been fitted."

This 32 Ford is now offered with spare parts and a clean Washington title.",
      "The car is finished in metallic green and is equipped with a white removable hardtop and electric door poppers. The rumble seat and hood are missing and were reportedly stolen at a car show in the mid-1990s. There is paint loss on the cowl and rust in the rockers. An unpainted spare hood is included in the sale.",
      "The 15″ steel wheels are painted to match the body and wear chrome dog-dish hubcaps. The tires are US Royal Super Safety 4-ply whitewalls. The car is equipped with a 4″ dropped front axle and four-wheel hydraulic drum brakes. Service in preparation for the sale included rebuilding the brake master cylinder and replacing the wheel cylinders.",
      "The cabin is upholstered in white tuck-and-roll vinyl with turquoise carpets and matching sheet metal.",
      "The three-spoke steering wheel sits ahead of a 100-mph speedometer and gauges for fuel level, oil pressure, charging status, and temperature. The five-digit odometer shows around 3k miles, though the total mileage is unknown.",
      "The 239ci flathead V8 is equipped with Edelbrock cylinder heads, an Edelbrock intake manifold, and triple Stromberg 97 carburetors. Service in preparation for the sale included changing the oil and replacing the fan belt, spark plugs, and battery.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a column-shifted three-speed manual transmission.",
      "A white soft top with side curtains, a spare windshield, a cover, an unpainted hood, literature, and prior registration documents will accompany the car."

      "This 1974 Honda CB360 spent time in long-term storage in Iowa before the seller’s acquisition from the spouse of the reported original owner in 2020. Subsequent recommision work included overhauling the Keihin carburetors, flushing the fuel tank, changing the oil, and replacing the battery, spark plugs, fuel lines, and tires. The bike is powered by a 356cc parallel twin paired with a six-speed transmission and is finished in Candy Orange. Equipment includes kick and electric starters, drum brakes, 18″ wire-spoke wheels, chrome fenders, street lighting, a two-up seat, a passenger backrest, rear crash bars, and a luggage rack. This CB360 shows 4,300 miles and is offered at no reserve with an owner’s manual, tool kit, handwritten service notes, and a clean Minnesota title in the seller’s name.",

      "The chrome handlebar carries dual mirrors and is mounted aft of Nippon Seiki instrumentation consisting of a 110-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 9,200-rpm redline. A bank of indicator lights is located between the gauges. The five-digit odometer shows 4,300 miles, approximately 200 of which were ridden under current ownership. The ignition cylinder was relocated to the handlebar under previous ownership.",
      "The 356cc parallel twin was factory rated at 34 horsepower and features dual Keihin carburetors, a chrome two-into-two exhaust system, and both kick and electric starters. Service in 2021 included rebuilding and synching the carburetors, flushing the fuel tank, changing the oil, adjusting the valves, setting the timing, and replacing the fuel lines and spark plugs. A Motobatt battery was installed in preparation for the sale.",

      "This Meyers Manx is a Signature Series example that was ordered by the seller’s family in 1999, and it rides on a custom-fabricated tubular steel chassis with an integrated roll bar and an independent rear suspension. Finished in red, the car is powered by a 1.6-liter flat-four equipped with dual carburetors and mated to a four-speed manual transaxle. Porsche bucket seats are trimmed in black leather with Tartan cloth inserts, and other highlights include 15” steel wheels, diamond-plate aluminum floors, a Vintage Speed shifter, a Woody’s Custom Shop digital media receiver, VDO instrumentation, and three-point seatbelts. This Manx is now offered on dealer consignment with a clean Michigan title listing the car as a 1967 Volkswagen.",
      "Initially finished in yellow, the fiberglass body shell was repainted in red before it was mounted to a custom-fabricated tubular steel chassis with an integrated roll cage. Exterior details include a black front bumper, driving lights, chrome headlight buckets, wind wings, and black taillight bezels surrounding the period Beetle-style taillights.",
      "Cream-finished 15” steel wheels wear baby-moon hubcaps and are mounted with 30.0×7.0” Mickey Thompson Baja Pro tires. The car is equipped with an independent rear suspension, and braking is handled by four-wheel drums.",
      "The fixed-back bucket seats were sourced from a Porsche 914 and are trimmed in black leather with Tartan cloth inserts. Removable tan cloth covers will accompany the car. The floors are constructed from diamond-plate aluminum, and additional appointments include a Vintage Speed shifter, a Woody’s Custom Shop digital media receiver, a roller accelerator, side pockets, and three-point seatbelts.",
      "The Grant GT steering wheel fronts a gold engine-turned instrument panel housing a VDO 120-mph speedometer and gauges for oil pressure, cylinder head temperature, alternator output, and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 1,300 miles.",
      "The 1.6-liter flat-four was sourced from GEX International of Booneville, Arkansas, and features dual carburetors and EMPI finned valve covers. Approximately 200 miles are said to have been added since the engine was installed in 2016 at Auto Europe of Birmingham, Michigan. The polished muffler is dented.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a four-speed manual transaxle. Bedliner material has been applied to portions of the underbody.",
      "A Meyers Manx identification tag indicates that the car is number 50 of 100 examples produced for the Signature Series. A second plaque riveted to the body shows the number 117427716, which is consistent with a Volkswagen Beetle produced for the 1967 model year and matches the VIN listed on the Michigan title, which describes the car as a 1967 Volkswagen."

The bike is finished in Double Clear Coat Black with chrome accents, and features include a digital instrument display, LED taillights, a black Corbin two-up seat, a trailing-link fork, a Unit Pro-Link linkage and monoshock, a single-sided swingarm, an enclosed driveshaft, optional chrome-finished 18″ and 17″ five-spoke wheels, triple Nissin disc brakes, electronic fuel injection, and a six-into-two exhaust system. The seller purchased the bike approximately 11 years ago, and it now has 9k miles. This Rune is offered with  literature and a clean Texas title in the seller’s name.",
      "The bike is finished in Double Clear Coat Black and features an aluminum twin-spar frame, a black Corbin two-up seat, a 6.1-gallon fuel tank, a chrome engine guard, and a side stand. The lighting package is comprised of dual headlights housed in a triangular color-keyed bucket with a chrome visor in addition to chrome turn signals and a pair of vertical LED taillight strips incorporated into the rear fender.",
      "Five-spoke aluminum wheels measuring 18″ up front and 17″ out back are finished in chrome, a $2k option, and are mounted with Dunlop Sportmax Roadsmart tires. Suspension consists of a chrome trailing-link fork along with a single-sided swingarm attached to a Unit Pro-Link linkage and remote-reservoir monoshock. Braking is handled by dual Nissin three-piston calipers mounted over cross-drilled rotors up front as well as a two-piston Nissin caliper and a cross-drilled rotor at the rear.",
      "The chrome set-back handlebar carries matching controls, grips, and mirrors as well as a Formotion Products clock and ambient temperature gauge. A digital screen housed in a chrome console atop the fuel tank displays a speedometer, a fuel-level readout, and a pair of trip meters. The digital odometer indicates 9k miles.",
      "The liquid-cooled 1,832cc SOHC flat-six features two valves per cylinder, electronic fuel injection, and a chrome six-into-two exhaust system. Factory-rated output was 118 horsepower. The battery was replaced in May 2024, and an oil-filler cap with an integrated oil temperature gauge has been installed.",
      "Power is transferred to the rear wheel through a hydraulically actuated clutch, a five-speed transmission, and a driveshaft enclosed within the swingarm.",
      "Manufacturer’s literature and keys will accompany the bike."

      "This 1989 Porsche 944 Turbo is powered by a turbocharged 2.5-liter inline-four paired with a five-speed manual transaxle and is finished in Guards Red over beige leather. Equipment includes the M030 sport suspension package, 16″ Club Sport alloy wheels, a limited-slip differential, pop-up headlights, fog lights, power-adjustable front seats, a sunroof, an alarm system, cruise control, and air conditioning. The car was initially sold in North Carolina and was purchased by the seller in September 2019. This 944 Turbo now shows 29k miles, and it is offered with initial purchase documents, the owner’s manual, service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean North Carolina title in the seller’s name.",
      "The car is finished in Guards Red and features a tilting sunroof with a removable panel as well as pop-up headlights, fog lights, a rear window wiper, and a rear spoiler. The front bumper is said to have been refinished.",
      "The 16″ Club Sport alloy wheels are mounted with Bridgestone Potenza RE-11 tires. The car is equipped with the M030 sport suspension package that includes adjustable Koni shocks, height-adjustable front spring perches, and larger sway bars. The seller notes the brake fluid was flushed prior to sale.",
      "The cabin features power-adjustable front seats and split-folding rear seats upholstered in beige leather along with a color-coordinated lower dashboard, center console, door panel inserts, and carpeting. Amenities include driver seat power lumbar support, an alarm system, cruise control, power windows and locks, dual front airbags, and an air conditioning system that has been converted to utilize R134a refrigerant. The AC system was recharged in preparation for the sale. The radio has been removed.",
      "The four-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a 180-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 6,400-rpm redline as well as gauges for coolant temperature, turbo boost pressure, oil pressure, voltage, and fuel level. The six-digit odometer shows 29k miles, approximately 150 of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The turbocharged 2.5-liter inline-four was factory rated at 247 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. The timing belt, a balance belt, the belt tensioner rollers, a balance shaft gear, and the water pump were replaced in July 2018. An oil change was performed in preparation for the sale.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a five-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. The clutch master cylinder and slave cylinder were replaced in June 2019, the muffler was replaced in February 2022, and the transmission fluid were replaced in preparation for the sale.",
      "Decoding the option sticker reveals the following information:",
      "The Carfax report is free of accidents or other damage."

Features include a Keihin carburetor, an upswept exhaust, a kick starter, drum brakes, 8″ steel wheels, chrome fenders, trail lighting, twist-lock handlebars, and a black vinyl seat. This Z50A Mini Trail is offered at no reserve in New York with a bill of sale.",

      "Multi-piece 8″ steel wheels wear Golden Boy tires. An inverted fork with black gaiters comprises the bike’s only suspension. Braking is handled by front and rear drums.",
      "The twist-lock folding handlebars carry a twist-grip throttle on the right and a run switch on the left. No instrumentation is present, therefore total mileage is unknown.",
      "The rebuilt 49cc four-stroke single was bored 0.5mm over and a valve job was performed before the engine was reassembled with a replacement piston and valves. Features include a Keihin carburetor, a kick starter, and an upswept exhaust system with chrome heat shields.",
      "Power is routed to the rear wheel through a three-speed semi-automatic transmission and a drive chain with a chrome guard."

The truck is finished in Victory Red over gray leather and features the Trailering and Comfort and Security packages, five-spoke 17″ alloy wheels, Bilstein shock absorbers, heated and power-adjustable front seats, air conditioning, and an AM/FM/cassette stereo. Acquired by the selling dealer in 2023, this GMT400 Tahoe now shows 201k miles and is offered at no reserve with recent service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Oregon title.",
      "This four-door example is finished in Victory Red (74U) and features front tow hooks, chrome bumpers and Westin tubular side steps, heated side mirrors, a cab visor, window visors, roof rails, rear barn doors, and a receiver hitch and trailer wiring harness.",
      "This is a relist after the vehicle was previously sold on BaT in May 2024 and the winning bidder was unable to follow through with their commitment to purchase due to circumstances outside of their control. This was not due to any fault with the vehicle and the winner’s buyer’s fee was refunded.",
      "Five-spoke 17″ alloy wheels from a later model are mounted with 265/70 Goodyear Wrangler SR-A tires. The truck is equipped with front and rear 46mm high-pressure gas shocks as part of the Comfort and Security Package, and braking is handled by front discs and rear drums.",
      "The heated and power-adjustable front seats and folding rear bench are trimmed in gray leather and joined by a color-coordinated dashboard, door panels, and carpets. Appointments include keyless entry, Homelink, front and rear cabin air conditioning, cruise control, an AM/FM/cassette stereo, and power windows, mirrors, and locks. The carpets are stained.",
      "The airbag steering wheel frames a 100-mph speedometer, a 6k-rpm tachometer, and gauges for fuel level, voltage, oil pressure, and coolant temperature. The six-digit odometer shows 201k miles, approximately 500 of which were added by the selling dealer.",
      "A replacement 5.7-liter Vortec V8 was rebuilt and installed in March 2024. The overhaul involved installing remanufactured cylinder heads, honing the cylinders, polishing the crankshaft, and replacing the rear main seal, camshaft and bearings, main and connecting rod bearings, piston rings, rocker arms, push rods, and intake manifold gaskets. Additional work consisted of installing a high-volume oil pump and changing the timing chain and gears, spark plugs, ignition wires, and distributor cap and rotor as well as performing fluid changes.",
      "Power is sent to the rear or all four wheels through a four-speed automatic transmission with overdrive as well as an AutoTrac four-wheel-drive system and a locking rear differential with 3.73:1 gearing.",
      "The Carfax report is free of accidents or other damage."

      "This 2008 Ducati Monster S4R S is #159 of 400 Tricolore examples produced, and it is finished in Italy’s national colors. Powered by a 998cc Testastretta L-twin paired with a six-speed transmission, the bike is equipped with carbon-fiber trim, adjustable Öhlins suspension, Brembo brake calipers, a tinted windscreen, 17″ Marchesini wheels, frame and fork sliders, a black Sargent seat with red piping and a painted tail cowl, and a two-into-two exhaust system with carbon-fiber Termignoni mufflers. Purchased by the seller on BaT in April 2023, this Monster S4RS has 11k miles and is now offered in Nevada with literature and a clean Florida title in the seller’s name.",
      "All Monster Tricolore examples feature a red, white, and green-painted tank and a matching rear cowl mounted over a Fabio Taglioni-designed tubular steel trellis frame. Features include a tinted windscreen, rear-set foot controls, a carbon-fiber front fender and accents, frame and fork sliders, a black Sargent seat with red piping, and a side stand. The seller notes the bike was dropped on the right side in July 2023 which resulted in scuffs and scrapes on engine slider, foot peg, rear brake lever and exhaust pipe heat guard, photos of which can be viewed in the gallery.",
      "The 17″ Marchesini ten-spoke wheels are mounted with Michelin Pilot Power 2CT tires. Braking is handled by Brembo calipers mounted over twin 320mm discs up front and a single inboard disc at the rear. The fully-adjustable Öhlins suspension includes a 43mm inverted front fork with titanium nitride-plated legs as well as a monoshock connected to the aluminum single-sided swingarm via a progressive linkage.",
      "The silver-finished alloy handlebar is secured aft of an instrument panel housing a white-dial 160-mph speedometer, a matching tachometer, and a bank of indicator lights. The digital odometer indicates 11k miles.",
      "A plaque affixed to the left side of the engine denotes the bike as #159 of 400 S4R S Tricolores produced.",
      "The liquid-cooled 998cc Testastretta L-twin features a desmodromic valvetrain, an oil cooler, an electric starter, and a two-into-two exhaust system with slip-on Termignoni carbon fiber mufflers. Work performed in February 2023 included replacing the timing belts, installing a K&N air filter, flushing the coolant, and changing the oil. The throttle position sensor was changed in December 2023.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheel through a multi-plate dry clutch, a six-speed transmission, and a drive chain. The clutch master cylinder was flushed in February 2023.",
      "Manufacturer’s literature, keys, and a rear stand will accompany the motorcycle."

      "This 1938 American Bantam Model 60 Speedster is a disassembled project that was reportedly sold new in Connecticut to the captain of the destroyer that the seller’s father served on during World War II. It was gifted by him to the seller’s family in 1948 and was used as a summer car before it spent several decades in storage. The car retains a 45ci inline-four that is said to have been rebuilt in the 2010s as well as a three-speed manual transmission. The fenders were finished in primer in preparation for the sale. This American Bantam project is now offered at no reserve in New Bern, North Carolina, with parts, parts invoices, literature, and a bill of sale.",
      "The American Austin Car Company was founded in 1929 in Butler, Pennsylvania, and built an American version of the British Austin Seven until filing for bankruptcy in 1934. The company was revived the following year by former Austin salesman Roy Evans, who commissioned designer Alexis de Sakhnoffsky to restyle the Seven into the American Bantam before production resumed in 1937. This example is said to have been delivered from the factory in black, and it was repainted using yellow lacquer in the 1970s. The fenders were were coated in primer in 2024. Parts, including a grille, headlights with Stablite lenses, a windshield frame, and taillights can be seen in the gallery. The bumpers are missing along with the convertible frame and top.",
      "The steel wheels were sandblasted and primed in 2008 before they were powder-coated black. They are mounted with BFGoodrich Silvertown whitewall bias-ply tires that were ordered from Coker Tire and installed approximately 10 years ago. Included Bantam-branded chrome hubcaps and trim rings can be seen in the gallery. The cable-actuated four-wheel drum brakes were reportedly serviced and adjusted in the 2010s, and replacement wheel bearings and grease seals were installed at that time.",
      "The floors in the stripped cabin were reportedly coated with fiberglass and painted with POR-15 during the 2010s. A three-spoke steering wheel is fitted along with a Bantam-branded combination gauge. Bucket seat shells are included in the sale and can be seen in the gallery along with removed red upholstery sections, an ignition switch and key, rubber pedal covers, and the removed speedometer, which includes a five-digit odometer showing 13k miles.",
      "The 45ci inline-four was fitted with replacement head studs and rod bolts from American Racing Products in the 2010s  as well as grease seals, spark plugs, ignition points, and a Tillotson carburetor. The cylinder head and intake manifold were resurfaced, and the radiator was also re-cored at that time. A replacement six-volt battery was installed in 2023, and the starter was rebuilt in 2024. The seller notes that the radiator mounting brackets will require repairs.",
      "The car retains its floor-shifted three-speed manual transmission and rear axle as well as front transverse and rear semi-elliptical leaf springs. The underside was coated with POR-15 during the 2010s, while the fuel tank was cleaned and coated with epoxy.",
      "The car does not have a title and is being sold as a project on a bill of sale."

      "This 1998 Ferrari F355 Berlinetta shows 19k miles following registration history in Washington and California, and it was purchased by its current owner in June 2003. An engine-out belt service was performed in March 2024. The car is finished in Titanium Silver over blue Connolly leather, and it is powered by a 3.5-liter DOHC V8 linked with a paddle-shifted six-speed F1 gearbox. Features include a Tubi Style muffler, 18″ five-spoke magnesium wheels, pop-up headlights, a Challenge-style rear grille, a Kenwood stereo, and automatic climate control. This F355 Berlinetta is now offered on dealer consignment with the owner’s manual, service records, a tool kit, luggage, a clean Carfax report, and a clean California title",
      "The Pininfarina-designed body is finished in Titanium Silver, and styling elements include pop-up headlights, integrated front fog lights, an integrated rear decklid spoiler, quad exhaust outlets, a vented engine cover, a Challenge-style rear grille, and air intakes on the doors and rocker panels. The right headlight lifter motor was replaced earlier this year.",
      "The 18″ five-spoke magnesium wheels are mounted with Pirelli P Zero tires. Ferrari-branded brake calipers are mounted over ventilated discs at each corner. The brake and power steering fluids were changed in March 2024.",
      "The cabin features sport seats trimmed in blue Connolly leather, and matching leather extends to the center console, door panel inserts, and dashboard. Amenities include automatic climate control, a Kenwood stereo, and drilled aluminum pedals. The air conditioning system was recharged in March 2024.",
      "The leather-wrapped steering wheel is equipped with paddle shifters and frames a 200-mph speedometer, a 10k-rpm tachometer, a gauge for coolant temperature, and a digital gear indicator. Ancillary instruments in the center stack include an analog clock and gauges for fuel level and oil pressure. The six-digit odometer shows 19k miles, approximately 3k of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The mid-mounted 3.5-liter DOHC V8 features five valves per cylinder and dry-sump lubrication for a factory-rated output of 375 horsepower and 268 lb-ft of torque. A Tubi Style muffler has been fitted. An engine-out belt service was completed in March 2024, and additional work included oil and coolant exchanges and replacing the battery, fuel filter, camshaft seals, air filters, spark plugs, and trunk and engine lid struts.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through an electrohydraulically operated six-speed F1 gearbox. The transaxle fluid was changed in March 2024.",
      "The Carfax report is free from accidents or other reported damage.",
      "The car most recently passed a California emissions test in February 2024, however, the Tubi Style muffler installed is not CARB-compliant."

      "This 1948 Willys-Overland sedan delivery is a non-running project truck that is said to have been stored on blocks in a Quonset hut in North Dakota for more than 35 years before being purchased out of Montana by the seller’s late uncle in 2014. Subsequent work involved sourcing a custom frame from Art Morrison Enterprises, stripping the body, installing a 6.2-liter LS3 V8 and a 4L65-E four-speed automatic transmission, adapting Strange Engineering independent front and rear suspension, fitting 1930s Dodge gauges, strengthening the fenders and the hood, and sourcing Detroit Steel Wheel 20″ artillery-style wheels, Wilwood brakes, Vintage Air climate control, and custom valve covers. This Willys project is now offered at no reserve by the seller with a binder of build records and various parts as well as power-of-attorney documentation and a Nebraska title in the uncle’s name.",
      "The body was removed from the frame and stripped using an acid-dipping process before being mounted to a custom-ordered frame from Art Morrison Enterprises. Fabrication work performed by No Coast Custom and Rod Shop of Lincoln, Nebraska, included reinforcing the fenders and the hood with double walls. Other equipment includes swing-out rear doors, So-Cal Speed Shop dual side mirrors, custom front and rear bumpers, custom headlights and taillights, refurbished hood latches, Detroit Speed windshield wipers, and replacement glass.",
      "Detroit Steel Wheel Co. Ambassador/Artillery 20″ wheels with chrome hubcaps are mounted with 245/40 Nexen N5000 Plus tires in the front and 295/40 Nexen Roadian HP tires in the rear. A Strange Engineering independent front suspension includes adjustable coilovers and an anti-roll bar, while the Strange Engineering four-link rear suspension utilizes coilovers and a Panhard bar. Power-assisted steering is based on an Opel-sourced rack and pinion. Wilwood disc brakes at each corner are augmented by a Wilwood ProSpindle kit.",
      "The bucket seats have been stripped of upholstery, and the floors were modified. Parts were purchased and preparations made for the vehicle to have six-way-power-adjustable seats as well as power windows, power door locks, and Vintage Air climate control.",
      "A 1934 Dodge gauge surround and 1933 Dodge gauges are installed in a fabricated dashboard. The five-digit mechanical odometer shows 65k miles, and true mileage is unknown.",
      "The 6.2-liter LS3 V8 was purchased from Friesen Chevrolet of Sutton, Nebraska, in 2015. Other equipment includes custom valve covers, a custom wiring harness, Billet Specialities pulleys and engine mounts, an AFCO radiator, exhaust headers, and a custom fuel cell.",
      "A 4L65-E Supermatic four-speed automatic transmission is paired with a Strange Engineering rear end with 31-spline axles.",
      "A sketch of the intended finished project—produced by No Coast Custom and Rod Shop—is shown above. More than 100 pages of receipts are pictured in the gallery below and said to exceed $140,000; a video of the seller’s uncle describing the build and the receipts is provided below.",
      "The Nebraska Department of Motor Vehicles has assigned a VIN to the vehicle, which no longer has a factory-applied identification plate. The title cites the number on the tag shown above (which is not attached to the vehicle) and lists the Year as 2015, the Make as “Asmbld Vehicle”, the Model as “1948 Willys Sedan Dlvry”, and the color as an abbreviation for black. The title also bears a Notice that reads: “This vehicle may be subject to an undisclosed interest bond number 150209″."

      "This 1978 Ford Ranchero GT Brougham was reportedly purchased new by an acquaintance of the owner and was acquired by the owner in 1999. Subsequent work consisted of repainting the vehicle in 2005 and servicing the fuel system in 2022. Finished in Champagne Metallic with white GT stripes over brown vinyl upholstery, the vehicle is powered by a 351ci V8 paired with a three-speed automatic transmission. Equipment includes power steering, power front disc brakes, Magnum 500-style wheels, the Brougham Decor Group, a Pioneer cassette stereo, cruise control, and air conditioning. This Ranchero is now offered on dealer consignment at no reserve in Yucca Valley, California, with manufacturer’s literature, service records, and a clean California title.",
      "The vehicle was repainted in Champagne Metallic circa 2005 and details include white GT stripes, quad headlights, rubber bumper guards, chrome bumpers, side markers, and dual sport mirrors.",
      "The Magnum 500-style 14″ wheels wear bright trim rings and are wrapped in 225/70 Futura GLS Super Sport white-letter tires. Work in 2012 consisted of replacing the shocks and servicing the brakes.",
      "The bucket seats are trimmed in brown vinyl upholstery joined by a color-coordinated dashboard pad and door panels. Equipment includes the Brougham Decor Group, a Pioneer cassette stereo, cruise control, air conditioning, three-point seatbelts, and clear rubber floormats. There are tears in both seat covers.",
      "The two-spoke steering wheel fronts an 85-mph speedometer, a tachometer, an analog clock, and auxiliary gauges. The odometer indicates 60k miles, approximately 2k of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The 351ci V8 was factory rated at 149 horsepower and 275 lb-ft of torque. Work in 2022 consisted of servicing the fuel system, tuning the carburetor, and replacing the battery. The vehicle most recently passed a Smog Check in July 2024.",
      "Power is delivered to the rear wheels via a three-speed Ford FMX automatic transmission.",
      "The vehicle is registered as Planned Non-operation in the state of California and may be subject to fees."

      "This 1981 Volkswagen Jetta coupe was modified in the 1980s and 90s by a prior owner, who reportedly used the European Jetta GTi as inspiration. A 2.0-liter Audi 3A block was mated to a solid-lifter cylinder head and a G-grind camshaft, and it was paired with a Rabbit GTI five-speed manual transaxle. Additional modifications include a Leistritz exhaust system, H&R coilovers, 15″ BBS RM wheels, and 16V brake components in addition to European bumpers, Hella horns, König front seats, and a MOMO steering wheel. Finished in Mexico Beige over a tan and brown interior, the car is further equipped with a sunroof, a power antenna, and an Audiobahn cassette stereo. Previously registered in California, the vehicle was purchased by its current owner in 2003 and relocated to Washington State. The timing belt was replaced in 2021, and the oil was changed in preparation for the sale. Showing 15k miles, this Jetta is now offered on dealer consignment in Oregon with parts and service records, spare parts, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Washington title.",
      "The car is finished in Mexico Beige with black trim and body-side moldings. Volkswagen European-specification bumpers and Hella E-code headlights have been fitted, and additional exterior details include a sunroof, a power antenna, a heated rear window, and GLI and 2.0 badging. Close-up photos of the finish are provided in the gallery below.",
      "This is a relist after the vehicle was previously sold on BaT in July 2024 and the winning bidder failed to follow through with their commitment to purchase. This was not due to any fault with the vehicle. The winner’s participation on BaT has been restricted and their buyer’s fee was not refunded.",
      "Silver-finished 15″ BBS RM alloy wheels are wrapped in 195/45 Toyo Extensa HP II tires. The suspension has been modified with H&R Street Performance coilovers along with a Neuspeed front chassis brace and rear sway bar, and Scirocco 16V braking components have been fitted along with a cross-drilled rotor at each corner.",
      "König bolstered front seats are upholstered in tan leather, and the door panels and rear bench are trimmed to match. Additional appointments include an Audiobahn AM/FM/cassette stereo connected to Concord speakers as well as a heater and defroster, MOMO pedal covers, a Wolfsburg-logo leather shift knob, and a bank of auxiliary switches added to the center console.",
      "The MOMO steering wheel wears a brown leather wrap and features a Wolfsburg-logo horn button. It frames a VDO 85-mph speedometer, a coolant-temperature gauge, and a MotoMeter 7k-rpm tachometer with an inset fuel-level gauge. Additional VDO gauges for vacuum, temperature, and pressure are housed in the center console. The six-digit odometer shows 15k miles.",
      "The 2.0-liter inline-four was assembled in 1988-89 using a replacement Audi 80 3A block, a Volkswagen JH solid-lifter cylinder head that was ported and polished, and a G-grind camshaft. An ABD Racing Big-Bore intake system, Setrab 13-row oil cooler, dual downpipe, and Leistritz no-catalyst exhaust system have been installed, as have braided stainless-steel lines, a Neuspeed strut-tower brace, and chrome-plated valve and belt covers. The timing belt was replaced in 2021, and the oil was most recently changed in May 2024. Cylinder compression was measured at that time, and the results can be viewed in the gallery.",
      "Power is routed to the front wheels through a replacement Rabbit GTI five-speed manual transaxle.",
      "A color-matching Zender front valance and side skirts are included in the sale.",
      "The Carfax report is free of accident or damage entries."

Other equipment includes a three-speed automatic transmission, a Sure-Grip differential, 3.90:1 rear-end gearing, widened rear wheels, an Air Grabber hood, a Holley carburetor, an Edelbrock intake manifold, an aluminum radiator, an auxiliary electric cooling fan, MSD ignition parts, Hooker headers, dual exhaust, power steering, front bucket seats, a center console, aftermarket auxiliary gauges, and an AM radio. This GTX was purchased by the seller in 2021 and is now offered with a spare hood and a clean Florida title in the seller’s name.",
      "Finished from the factory in Deep Burnt Orange metallic (FK5), the car was repainted during the aforementioned refurbishment. Black stripes adorn the hood and the body sides, and the tail panel also has black accents. Other features include quad headlights, chrome bumpers, GTX badging, dual side mirrors, and dual exhaust outlets. An Air Grabber hood is currently installed, and a domed hood painted to match the car will accompany the vehicle and is pictured in the gallery below. The seller notes chips in the paint. The headlights and taillamps do not work, and the hood-mounted turn-signal indicators have been removed.",
      "Rallye-style 15″ wheels are mounted with BFGoodrich Radial T/A tires; the rear wheels measure 10″ wide. The car is equipped with power steering, and braking is provided by unassisted drums at each corner.",
      "The front bucket seats and the rear bench are trimmed in orange vinyl, and woodgrain trim accents the dashboard and the door panels. Interior equipment includes front-seat shoulder belts, rear lap belts, a center console, an AM radio, and a heater. The lights on the center console are inoperable.",
      "The three-spoke steering wheel has a horn ring and fronts a 150-mph speedometer and gauges for fuel level, coolant temperature, oil pressure, and amperage. An AutoMeter Phantom tachometer with a shift light is installed adjacent to the speedometer, and two aftermarket gauges for water temperature are positioned ahead of the shifter and accompanied by an aftermarket gauge for oil pressure. The five-digit odometer shows 38k miles, approximately 500 of which were added under current ownership; true mileage is unknown.",
      "The 440ci V8 is said to have been installed by Koffel’s Place around 1999 and was bored .030″ over for a total displacement of 446ci. The engine is augmented by B1 Heads cylinder heads and valve covers, a Holley carburetor, an Edelbrock Performer RPM intake manifold, an MSD Ignition 6AL digital ignition controller, an MSD Pro-Billet Distributor, a Jacobs Electronics Ultra Coil, a BeCool aluminum radiator, an auxiliary electric cooling fan, and Hooker Super Competition headers. The belts, spark plugs, and plug wires were replaced in 2021, and the fluids were changed most recently in 2023, according to the seller.",

      "This 1988 Ford Thunderbird Turbo Coupe was modified under prior ownership in the style of Bill Elliott’s 1980s NASCAR race car. It was then used in a NASCAR commercial prior to its acquisition by the selling dealer in 2024 and listing on BaT in April 2024. Finished in silver under a Coors livery wrap, the car retains much of its Medium Gray leather street car interior sans door panels and has been fitted with a window net, a rear spoiler, a front air dam, coilover suspension, and gold 15″ Bassett wheels with racing slicks. It is powered by a turbocharged 2.3-liter inline-four mated with a five-speed manual transmission and a Traction-Lok limited-slip differential, and additional equipment includes tinted windows, a Grant steering wheel, electronic climate control, and a cassette stereo with a graphic equalizer. This modified Turbo Coupe shows 174k miles and is now offered at no reserve in Lauderhill, Florida, for off-road use only with service records and a bill of sale.",
      "Finished in Silver Clearcoat Metallic (9Z), the car has been wrapped in a replica of Bill Elliott’s Melling Racing #9 Coors livery. The side mirrors have been removed, and lighting components are not visible. A rear spoiler and front air dam have been added, with the latter item showing damage. The fenders have been cut to clear the tires, and the windows have been tinted. Imperfections are noted in the wrap.",
      "Gold 15″ Bassett wheels are mounted with a mix of Goodyear Eagle and Hoosier slick tires, some of which show cracking. Aftermarket adjustable coilovers have been installed along with adjustable camber plates, and braking is from discs all around.",
      "The interior retains front and rear seats upholstered in Medium Gray leather, while the door panels have been removed. Other factory equipment includes air conditioning, power lumbar support for the driver, and a cassette stereo with a graphic equalizer.",
      "The Grant steering wheel fronts a 95-mph speedometer, a tachometer, and auxiliary gauges for oil pressure, coolant temperature, amperage, and fuel level. The six-digit odometer shows 174k miles, approximately 10 of which were added under current ownership. A Bosch boost pressure gauge has been added beneath the dash.",
      "The turbocharged 2.3-liter inline-four was factory rated at 190 horsepower when paired with a five-speed manual transmission. A Champion aluminum radiator is fitted.",
      "Additional underside photos are presented below.",
      "The Carfax report shows no accidents and notes that the car was designated a gross polluter by the state of California in 2005.",
      "The sale does not include a title, as the car is being sold for off-road use only on a bill of sale."

      "This 1978 Ford F-250 Ranger XLT 4×4 pickup reportedly spent time with a single owner in Montana until the seller’s acquisition in 2024. Recent work consisted of rebuilding the carburetor and replacing the fuel pump. Power is provided by a 400ci V8 linked with a four-speed manual transmission, a dual-range transfer case, and a rear limited-slip differential and the truck is finished in two-tone silver metallic and candyapple red over red cloth upholstery. A factory white camper shell is fitted and equipment includes a receiver hitch, cab clearance lights, power steering, power front disc brakes, white 16″ steel wheels, manually locking front hubs, an AM/FM stereo, a Realistic CB radio, and air conditioning. This F-250 Ranger XLT shows 75k miles and is now offered with a Deluxe Marti report, a window sticker, the owner’s manual, service records, spare parts, and a clean Montana title in the seller’s name.",
      "The truck is finished in two-tone silver metallic and candyapple red and features a Styleside bed as well as dual towing mirrors, a factory camper shell, a receiver hitch, a sliding rear window, a lockable tool stowage box, a chrome front bumper, cab clearance lights, rear stone guards, and bright bodyside moldings with vinyl inserts. The seller notes that the truck was keyed on the dealership lot and the upper passenger door and box sides were repainted. Paint and body blemishes are displayed in the gallery.",
      "White 16″ steel wheels are mounted with 285/75 Bighorn Maxxis M/T tires. The truck is equipped with manually locking front hubs and power steering, and braking is provided by power-assisted front discs and rear drums. A spare tire is mounted on the under-frame slide-out carrier.",
      "The bench seat is trimmed in red cloth upholstery joined by a color-coordinated dashboard, door panels, and carpets. Woodgrain trim lines the dashboard and upper door panels, and interior amenities include air conditioning, an AM/FM stereo, a Realistic CB radio, a trailer brake controller, and rubber floor mats.",
      "The two-spoke steering wheel frames an 85-mph speedometer as well as gauges for coolant temperature, oil pressure, battery charge status, and fuel level. The five-digit odometer shows 75k miles, approximately 200 of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The 400ci V8 was factory rated at 169 horsepower. Recent work consisted of rebuilding the carburetor and replacing the fuel pump. An oil change was performed most recently in September 2023.",
      "Power is sent to the rear or all four wheels through a four-speed manual transmission, a dual-range transfer case, and a rear limited-slip differential. The rear differential was serviced in September 2023.",
      "The Deluxe Marti Report lists factory colors, options, and production statistics. The manufacturer’s literature, initial sales paperwork, Ownercard, service records, and spare wheels and tires accompany the truck."

    "description": [
      "This 1982 Porsche 911 Turbo is said to have been ordered new by a German owner and subsequently sent to RUF Automobile GmbH for conversion to BTR Lightweight specification. The car was reportedly sold upon completion to a Japanese collector and remained in Japan until it was purchased by the selling dealer and imported to the US in 2023. Finished in Grand Prix White over black cloth, the car is powered by a turbocharged Type 930/60 flat-six that was modified by RUF to a displacement of 3.4 liters and is mated to a RUF five-speed manual transaxle. Additional features include RUF valances, modified Bilstein suspension, cross-drilled and ventilated disc brakes, staggered-width Fuchs-style alloy wheels, a quad-outlet exhaust system, a manual boost controller, an oil cooler, a sunroof, air conditioning, and a Blaupunkt cassette player. Since its acquisition by the current owner on BaT in November 2023, RUF badging, door sill trim, pedals, and floor mats have been added, the Recaro front seats were fitted with houndstooth inserts, the wheels were refinished, a Porsche Classic Communication Management stereo linked to Kicker speakers was added, and the headlights were replaced. This RUF-modified 930 is now offered in San Diego, California, with a set of removed Cup-style side mirrors, RUF documentation, service invoices, magazine articles featuring the car, a tool kit, an air compressor, import documents, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Montana title.",
      "RUF began offering modified versions of the Porsche 930 in 1977 before being granted German manufacturing status in 1981 and introducing the BTR, or Gruppe B Turbo RUF, in 1983 as the first model to carry a RUF VIN. In addition to the BTRs constructed from bodies-in-white, RUF offered conversions of customer-supplied Porsches to various states of BTR specification.",
      "The selling dealer notes the car was purchased direct from the Porsche factory (code COO Germany and code 1120010 Porsche factory for delivery partner). It is believed that the base cars produced in white for delivery to RUF Automobile GmbH, Pfaffenhausen, Germany carried unique two-digit commission codes from 01-46, and the commission number for this particular example is 33. The car left the Porsche factory finished in Grand Prix White and was optioned with a power-operated sunroof and a tinted windshield.",
      "According to the selling dealer, this example was converted to BTR Lightweight specifications when new. The bodywork included removal of the front and rear valences and the inner front and rear steel substructure, bracing and brackets, and the installation of RUF specific, lightweight replacement items and accounts for nearly 200lb in weight reduction. The RUF front valance has an integrated spoiler and oil cooler opening flanked by brake-cooling inlets, and the RUF rear valance is vented.",
      "Paintwork has been performed on the hood, front valance, rocker panels, and wheel arches, and imperfections shown in the photo gallery below include touched-up areas on the left-rear fender and blemishes on the decklid and right-rear fender. A pair of RUF Cup-style side mirrors are said to have been removed in favor of standard mirrors during the car’s time in Japan and are included in the sale, and replacement H4 headlights have been installed.",
      "Fuchs-style 16″ alloy wheels were stripped, refinished, and fitted with hand-painted center caps, and they are wrapped in 205/55 front and 225/50 rear Pirelli P Zero Rosso tires that show date codes from 2022 and 2023. The suspension was modified by RUF and features Bilstein shock absorbers all around. Stopping is handled by four-piston calipers acting upon slotted and ventilated disc brakes all around, and the system was refreshed in 2023.",
      "RUF originally installed lightweight Recaro seats in models they modified. The cabin houses a pair of Recaro Idealsitz SR seats trimmed in black cloth upholstery with houndstooth inserts, and the seat backs were reupholstered. Legacy Autosport in Camarillo, California installed a Porsche PCCM stereo and Kicker speakers, and RUF pedals, sill plates, and floor mats were also installed. Additional features include color-matched carpeting, power windows, air conditioning, a Blaupunkt cassette player, and a manual boost controller located in front of the rear seats.",
      "The three-spoke steering wheel features a RUF horn pad and sits ahead of a RUF-branded 8k-rpm tachometer and 300-km/h speedometer as well as auxiliary gauges for fuel level, oil level, oil temperature, oil pressure, and boost pressure. The six-digit odometer shows 84k kilometers (~52k miles), and the current title lists an odometer reading of 83,321 miles.",
      "RUF BTR-specification modifications to the Type 930/60 flat-six included a displacement increase to 3.4 liters via a widened bore and the installation of RUF-specific pistons, cylinder heads, and camshafts. A higher-capacity intercooler was also fitted, while boost pressure was increased over that of the factory 911 Turbo. Output claimed by RUF was 374 horsepower and 354 lb-ft of torque. An engine-out service including the replacement of seals is said to have been performed after the car’s arrival in the US.",
      "Approximately $15k worth of service was performed between August and November 2023, with a further ~$15k spent since the current owner’s acquisition.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels via a five-speed manual transmission that was reportedly fitted during the RUF conversion and is said to have been overhauled in 2000. The exhaust system was removed, stripped and re-powder coated in special high temperature material.",
      "A letter provided by RUF in September 2023 lists the BTR engine modifications as well as the RUF bodywork, instruments, and suspension. Two Japanese-language magazine articles featuring the car are included in the gallery, as are English translations provided by the selling dealer.",
      "The Carfax report is free of accidents or other issues and lists the purchase and titling of the car in 2023."

      "This 2013 Chevrolet Corvette 427 convertible is one of 2,552 examples produced for the single model year and was optioned with the 1SC Package, the 427 Heritage Package, and a six-speed manual gearbox, which is paired with a 7.0-liter LS7 V8. Finished in Torch Red over Ebony upholstery, the car has 9k miles and is equipped with a limited-slip differential, 19″ and 20″ multi-spoke alloy wheels, a black convertible soft top, xenon headlights, a head-up display, heated power-adjustable seats, and Keyless Access. This C6 427 was acquired by the owner in 2023 and is now offered on dealer consignment with a window sticker, the owner’s manual, two keys, a clean Carfax report, and a clean North Carolina title.",
      "The car is finished in Torch Red and has a power-retractable black soft top. Additional details include xenon headlights, fog lights, Z06-style carbon-fiber fenders, a carbon-fiber hood, satin black hood stripes, and polished quad exhaust outlets. The front spoiler has scratches, and the quarter panel vents have chips.",
      "The 19″ and 20″ multi-spoke alloy wheels are mounted with staggered-width Michelin tires. Braking is handled by red-finished Corvette-branded calipers over cross-drilled and ventilated discs at each corner. The right-rear wheel has curb damage.",
      "The heated power-adjustable bucket seats are upholstered in Ebony leather with microsuede inserts, Corvette logos on the headrests, and red stitching that extends to the dashboard, center console, and door panels. Carpeted floor mats line the footwells, and additional appointments include Keyless Access, push-button start, a head-up display, a CD stereo, a Bose sound system, cruise control, and automatic climate control.",
      "The three-spoke steering wheel frames a 200-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 7k-rpm redline as well as gauges for oil pressure, coolant temperature, voltage, and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 9k miles, approximately 600 of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The 7.0-liter LS7 V8 features a dry-sump lubrication system and was factory rated at 505 horsepower and 470 lb-ft of torque.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed manual gearbox and a limited-slip differential. An oil change was performed in 2024.",
      "The window sticker lists initial delivery to Lawrence Chevrolet of Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, along with factory colors, equipment, options, and a total vehicle price of $88,600. The owner’s manual and two keys are also included in the sale.",
      "The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage."

    "description": [
      "This 1950 Ford F-47 is a Canadian-market pickup that is finished in two-tone green and black over brown upholstery and is powered by a 239ci flathead V8 paired with a three-speed manual transmission. Equipment includes wood bed stakes, a wood-lined bed floor, lap belts, a 12-volt electrical system, driving lights, 16″ steel wheels, a Holley carburetor, and a heater. The truck was refurbished in the late 1990s and was acquired by the current owner approximately a decade ago. This F-47 pickup is now offered on dealer consignment in Texas with transferrable New York registration.",
      "The truck was repainted in green with black fenders in the late 1990s, and equipment includes running boards, a wood-lined bed floor, wood bed stakes, black bumpers, driving lights, and quarter vent windows. Bullet hole-style decals have been added to the left front fender and driver’s door. Chips and other blemishes around the body can be seen in the gallery.",
      "The 16″ black-painted steel wheels wear chrome trim rings and Ford-branded hubcaps, and they are mounted with 6.5-16 Tornel tires. Braking is handled by drums at each corner. The master cylinder and wheel cylinders were reportedly replaced in preparation for the sale.",
      "The cabin features a bench seat upholstered in brown, along with body-color metal surfaces. Lap belts are fitted for two occupants, and the truck is equipped with a heater.",
      "The three-spoke steering wheel fronts a 100-mph speedometer and gauges for fuel level, oil pressure, battery voltage, and coolant temperature. An aftermarket gauge is fitted below the dash. The five-digit mechanical odometer shows 2,500 miles, and total mileage is unknown.",
      "The 239ci flathead V8 was factory rated at 100 horsepower and features a block heater as well as a 12-volt electrical conversion with an alternator in place of the factory generator. The Holley 94 carburetor was rebuilt and an oil change performed in preparation for the sale.",
      "Power is delivered to the rear wheels through a three-speed manual transmission."

    "description": [
      "This 1963 Porsche 356B is one of approximately 310 Carrera 2 GS examples built on the T6 platform between 1962 and 1964 and is among 27 built with a retractable sunroof. Completed on April 1, 1963, the car was initially designated as a company car and is believed to have been driven by Porsche public relations manager Baron Huschke von Hanstein before being sold to its first private owner in the mid-1960s. After two changes of hand in Germany, it was sold to a New York owner in the 1970s, and at the end of the decade, moved to the UK, where it underwent a refurbishment between the late 1990s and 2000s. Following completion of the project, the car was featured on the cover of Classic Porsche magazine in 2013 and was later purchased by its current owner in California in 2018. Wearing a repaint in its factory shade of Light Ivory, it is powered by a replacement 1,966cc Type 587 four-cam flat-four that features a plain-bearing crankshaft, dry-sump lubrication, and dual-throat Solex carburetors. Additional equipment includes a four-speed manual transaxle, four-wheel annular disc brakes, Koni shock absorbers, a camber compensator, silver-painted 15” wheels, an Eberspacher gas heater, a wood-rimmed steering wheel, and a Blaupunkt radio. This Carrera 2 sunroof coupe is now offered on dealer consignment with a copy of its Kardex, historical documentation, invoices, a tool kit, a battery charger, and a clean California title.",
      "The Carrera variant was introduced in 1955 with power from a derivation of the four-cam engine designed by Dr. Ernst Furhmann for use in Porsche’s competition efforts. In 1957, the Carrera offerings were divided into the GT and GS, or de Luxe, models, with the latter more luxuriously equipped for comfortable road use. Launched in late 1961 on the T6 platform, the Carrera 2 brought about a further displacement increase to two liters as well as the first production use of Porsche’s annular disc brakes.",
      "This example is said to have received a repaint in its original shade of Light Ivory during the refurbishment performed in the 2000s by Roger Bray Restoration in Exeter, UK. Various chips are noted on areas of the finish. Features include a retractable sunroof, body-color bumpers without guards, a driver-side mirror, a fender-mounted antenna, twin decklid grilles, and a rear apron through which dual exhaust outlets pass.",
      "Silver-painted wheels wear Porsche-crest hubcaps and are wrapped in 185/70R15 Avon Radial tires, as is a matching spare secured in the front compartment. Annular disc brakes incorporate calipers positioned on the inner edge of the rotors allowing for a larger disc diameter. A replacement dual-circuit master cylinder was installed in 2016, and the brakes are said to have been adjusted in preparation for the sale.",
      "The cabin houses a pair of bucket seats trimmed in black leatherette with Pepita cloth inserts, while black leatherette covers the fold-down rear seats and door panels. Additional features include charcoal square-weave carpeting, black rubber floor mats, front shoulder belts, a lockable glovebox, a passenger-side grab handle, and a Blaupunkt push-button radio. An Eberspacher gas heater is situated in the front compartment.",
      "The wood-rimmed steering wheel sits ahead of a body-color dash fascia housing green-letter VDO instrumentation including an 8k-rpm tachometer, a 250-km/h speedometer, and a combination gauge monitoring oil temperature and fuel level. The five-digit odometer shows 27k kilometers (~17k miles), approximately 1k of which have been added under current ownership. Additional instruments include a MotoMeter outside/inside thermometer and a clock.",
      "The Type 587/1 flat-four carried over the quad overhead camshafts, plain-bearing crankshaft, dry-sump lubrication, and dual-throat Solex carburetors of the previous version of Fuhrmanm’s powerplant, but featured a longer stroke for a displacement increase to 1,966cc. This example’s engine is a replacement that is said to have been overhauled during the refurbishment performed in the 2000s. The cam lobes were replaced in 2016, and the oil thermostat was replaced in 2019, while the dynamo was rebuilt in 2023. Work performed in preparation for the sale is said to have included adjustment of the carburetors and an oil change.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels via a dual-mount Type 741 four-speed manual transaxle.",
      "The Kardex lists the original colors and describes the original handler as “Werkseigener Wagen,” or “factory-owned car,” and lists the first owner as “Presse.” Correspondence from Porsche Great Britain shown in the gallery below also notes that the car was originally owned by the factory."

      "This 2009 Chevrolet Corvette ZR1 is finished in black over Ebony leather and has 881 miles following history in Georgia, South Carolina, Arizona, and Montana. It is powered by a supercharged 6.2-liter LS9 V8 linked with a six-speed manual gearbox and a limited-slip differential, and it was ordered with the 3ZR Premium Equipment Group. Other equipment includes chrome 19″ and 20″ multi-spoke wheels, Brembo ceramic-composite brakes, xenon headlights, a Bose sound system, navigation, a head-up display, heated power-adjustable seats, and Keyless Access. Purchased by the seller in June 2022, this C6 ZR1 is now offered in Vermont with a build sheet, the owner’s manual, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Montana title in the name of the seller’s LLC.",
      "The C6 featured a hydro-formed aluminum chassis paired with composite and carbon-fiber bodywork. This example is one of a reported 368 ZR1 examples finished in black (41U) for the model year, and it features xenon headlights, an exposed carbon-fiber roof, a clear engine cover, polished quad exhaust outlets, and a carbon-fiber front splitter and side skirts.",

      "The cabin houses power-adjustable bucket seats upholstered in Ebony leather along with a color-coordinated dashboard, center console, door panels, and carpets. The car was optioned with the 3ZR Premium Equipment Group, which added heated seats with position memory settings for the driver along with a power-adjustable steering column, steering wheel audio controls, a Bose sound system, navigation, and a CD stereo. Additional amenities include Keyless Access, push-button start, a head-up display, cruise control, and dual-zone automatic climate control.",
      "The three-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a 220-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 6,500-rpm redline as well as gauges for oil pressure, coolant temperature, boost, and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 881 miles, approximately 200 of which were added under current ownership.",

      "This 1995 Ducati 916 is one of 300 examples produced in the Senna Edition, all of which combine a Strada-specification 916cc desmodromic L-twin with the rear subframe, brakes, and carbon-fiber trim of the SP model. The bike is finished in a two-tone Senna scheme and features a six-speed transmission, three-spoke 17″ Brembo wheels, clip-on handlebars, an adjustable Showa fork, an Öhlins piggyback monoshock, triple Brembo disc brakes, a carbon-fiber front fender, an integrated windscreen, a black vinyl Monoposto seat, Termignoni carbon-fiber mufflers, Weber-Marelli electronic fuel injection, carbon-fiber heel guards, and a side stand. The seller purchased the bike last year and has since added a handful of the 765 kilometers (~475 miles) shown. This 916 is now offered in Canada with its paddock stand, a bike cover, the removed exhaust components, tools, literature, and British Columbia registration.",
      "The Massimo Tamburini-designed bodywork is finished in a two-tone scheme with silver and red graphics, and it is mounted over a trellis frame. Features include an integrated windscreen, a black vinyl Monoposto seat, a carbon-fiber front fender, fairing-mounted mirrors, carbon-fiber heel guards, a 4.4-gallon fuel tank, and a side stand.",
      "Red three-spoke 17″ Brembo wheels are mounted with Michelin tires. Suspension consists of an adjustable Showa 43mm inverted fork as well as an Öhlins piggyback monoshock mounted to the single-sided swingarm. Brembo braking components include dual 320mm discs and four-piston calipers up front as well as a 220mm disc and a two-piston caliper at the rear.",
      "Clip-on handlebars are secured below the upper triple clamp, which has a mounting point for the piston-style steering damper. Instrumentation consists of a 300 km/h speedometer, a 13k-rpm tachometer, a coolant temperature gauge, and an array of indicator lights. The five-digit odometer shows 765 kilometers (~475 miles), a handful of which were ridden under current ownership.",
      "The top triple clamp bears a serialized plaque listing the bike as #071 of the Senna Edition units produced for the model year.",
      "The liquid-cooled 916cc L-twin features Weber-Marelli electronic fuel injection, four desmodromically actuated valves per cylinder, and a dual exhaust system with under-tail Termignoni carbon-fiber mufflers. Factory-rated output was 114 horsepower and 66 lb-ft of torque. The seller notes that the timing belts were replaced and fluids services were performed in Spring 2024.",
      "Power is routed to the rear wheel through a dry clutch, a six-speed transmission, and a drive chain.",
      "A tool kit, manufacturer’s literature, a paddock stand, removed exhaust components, and a cover will accompany the bike.",
      "The bike is being sold on its British Columbia registration, which serves as the ownership document in British Columbia, Canada."

      "This 1995 Land Rover Defender 90 is a left-hand-drive example that was initially delivered to Italy before it was acquired by the seller and imported to the US in 2022. It is finished in Alpine White with County graphics over black vinyl and powered by a 2.5-liter 300Tdi turbodiesel inline-four linked to a five-speed manual transmission, a dual-range transfer case, a locking center differential, and a limited-slip rear differential. Equipment includes front disc brakes, white 16″ Rostyle wheels, LED exterior lighting, tubular side steps, a folding rear step, and inward-facing rear bench seats. This Defender 90 shows 334k kilometers (~208k miles) and is offered with a British Motor Industry Heritage Trust certificate, service records, spare synthetic wood flooring, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Arizona title in the seller’s name.",
      "The truck is finished in Alpine White (456) with County graphics and features LED lighting, windshield vents, alpine windows, black wheel arch flares, tubular side steps, a folding rear step, and a tow ball. The seller notes that doors were aligned under current ownership. The rear window wiper is disconnected.",
      "White 16″ Rostyle wheels are mounted with 235/70 BFGoorich All-Terrain T/A KO2 tires, and a spare is affixed to the swing-away rear tire carrier. Braking is handled by front discs and rear drums. The seller states that the brake booster, ball joints, tie rod ends, and power steering pump and hoses were replaced in 2022.",
      "The front bucket seats are upholstered in black vinyl, and interior appointments include a locking center console and a cabin heater. The seller notes that the right window crank was replaced under current ownership. The headliner is sagging.",
      "The two-spoke steering wheel fronts a 150-km/h speedometer and gauges for coolant temperature and fuel level. The six-digit odometer shows 334k kilometers (~208k miles), approximately 10k of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The cargo area features inward-facing bench seats, synthetic wood flooring, sliding side windows, and cargo divider bars.",
      "The 2.5-liter 300Tdi turbodiesel inline-four was factory rated at 111 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque. The crankshaft and cooling hoses were reportedly replaced in 2022, and the rear main seal, timing belt, and engine oil were changed in October 2023.",
      "Power is routed to all four wheels through a five-speed manual transmission, a dual-range transfer case, a locking center differential, and a limited-slip rear differential.",
      "The British Motor Industry Heritage Trust certificate lists an April 25, 1995 build date along with factory colors, serial numbers, and initial delivery to Rover Italia Spa.",
      "The Carfax report is free of accidents or other damage and shows history in Texas and Arizona from an initial entry in November 2022."

      "This 1995 Land Rover Defender 90 is a left-hand-drive example that was initially delivered to Italy before it was acquired by the seller and imported to the US in 2022. It is finished in Alpine White with County graphics over black vinyl and powered by a 2.5-liter 300Tdi turbodiesel inline-four linked to a five-speed manual transmission, a dual-range transfer case, a locking center differential, and a limited-slip rear differential. Equipment includes front disc brakes, white 16″ Rostyle wheels, LED exterior lighting, tubular side steps, a folding rear step, and inward-facing rear bench seats. This Defender 90 shows 334k kilometers (~208k miles) and is offered with a British Motor Industry Heritage Trust certificate, service records, spare synthetic wood flooring, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Arizona title in the seller’s name.",
      "The truck is finished in Alpine White (456) with County graphics and features LED lighting, windshield vents, alpine windows, black wheel arch flares, tubular side steps, a folding rear step, and a tow ball. The seller notes that doors were aligned under current ownership. The rear window wiper is disconnected.",
      "White 16″ Rostyle wheels are mounted with 235/70 BFGoorich All-Terrain T/A KO2 tires, and a spare is affixed to the swing-away rear tire carrier. Braking is handled by front discs and rear drums. The seller states that the brake booster, ball joints, tie rod ends, and power steering pump and hoses were replaced in 2022.",
      "The front bucket seats are upholstered in black vinyl, and interior appointments include a locking center console and a cabin heater. The seller notes that the right window crank was replaced under current ownership. The headliner is sagging.",
      "The two-spoke steering wheel fronts a 150-km/h speedometer and gauges for coolant temperature and fuel level. The six-digit odometer shows 334k kilometers (~208k miles), approximately 10k of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The cargo area features inward-facing bench seats, synthetic wood flooring, sliding side windows, and cargo divider bars.",
      "The 2.5-liter 300Tdi turbodiesel inline-four was factory rated at 111 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque. The crankshaft and cooling hoses were reportedly replaced in 2022, and the rear main seal, timing belt, and engine oil were changed in October 2023.",
      "Power is routed to all four wheels through a five-speed manual transmission, a dual-range transfer case, a locking center differential, and a limited-slip rear differential.",
      "The British Motor Industry Heritage Trust certificate lists an April 25, 1995 build date along with factory colors, serial numbers, and initial delivery to Rover Italia Spa.",
      "The Carfax report is free of accidents or other damage and shows history in Texas and Arizona from an initial entry in November 2022."

      "This 1985 Mazda RX-7 S is said to have remained with its original owner until 2020, and it was acquired by the current owner on BaT in March 2024. Powered by a 1.1-liter 12A rotary paired with a five-speed manual transmission, it is finished in Tender Blue over gray cloth upholstery. Equipment includes 13″ four-spoke alloy wheels, power-assisted front disc brakes, pop-up headlights, an AM/FM stereo, and air conditioning. Showing 35k miles, this RX-7 is now offered by the seller on behalf of the owner with a clean Carfax report and a clean California title in the owner’s name.",
      "The car is finished in Tender Blue and is equipped with pop-up headlights, black body-side moldings, dual black-finished mirror housings, a power antenna, and polished twin exhaust outlets.",
      "Silver-finished 13″ four-spoke alloy wheels are mounted with 185/70 Kumho Solus TA11 tires. Braking is handled by power-assisted front discs and rear drums.",
      "The bucket seats are upholstered in patterned gray cloth that extends to the door-panel inserts. Additional appointments include adjustable driver-seat lumbar support, a digital clock, an AM/FM stereo, a rear window defroster, and air conditioning.",
      "The three-spoke steering wheel frames a 140-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 7k-rpm redline as well as gauges for oil pressure, voltage, coolant temperature, and fuel level. The six-digit odometer shows 35k miles, approximately 175 of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The 1.1-liter 12A Wankel rotary was factory equipped with a four-barrel carburetor and was rated at 101 horsepower and 107 lb-ft of torque. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a five-speed manual transmission. An oil change was performed and the fuel filter and drive belts were replaced in April 2024.",
      "The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage."

      "This 1971 Honda SL70 was acquired in 2014 by the seller, who subseuqently carried out a refurbishment that involved refinishing the bodywork in red and powder-coating the frame in silver. The bike is powered by a 72cc SOHC four-stroke single mated to a four-speed transmission, and equipment includes wire-spoke wheels with chromed rims, drum brakes, preload-adjustable shocks, a Keihin carburetor, a black-finished exhaust system, a black vinyl solo seat, trail lighting, handlebar-mounted mirrors, and a side stand. This SL70 is now offered at no reserve with a clean California title in the seller’s name.",
      "The bodywork was refinished in red with white accents as part of the aforementioned refurbishment. The steel double-cradle frame was powder-coated in silver at that time, and additional details include red and blue badges, a 1.3-gallon fuel tank, a solo seat upholstered in black vinyl, a headlight, a taillight, and a side stand.",
      "Chrome-finished steel rims measuring 16″ up front and 14″ out back are mounted with knobby tires. Stopping power is provided by drum brakes at both ends, and suspension consists of a conventional telescopic fork  along with a pair of preload-adjustable shocks mounted to the swingarm.",
      "The chrome cross-braced handlebar carries a pair of round mirrors, bright levers, and lighting and ignition switchgear. The bike is not equipped with an odometer or other instrumentation, therefore true mileage is unknown.",
      "The horizontal 72cc SOHC four-stroke single is equipped with a kick starter, a Keihin carburetor, and a black-finished exhaust system with an upswept muffler that carries a chrome heat shield and a spark arrestor. An oil change was carried out in February 2024. The fuel line connecting the petcock to the carburetor is missing.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheel through a four-speed transmission and a drive chain.",
      "The motorcycle is registered as Planned Non-Operation in the state of California."

      "This 2011 Porsche Boxster is finished in Carrara White over Sand Beige standard leather and is powered by a 2.9-liter flat-six paired with a six-speed manual transaxle. The car spent time registered in Virginia and Maryland before the selling dealer’s recent acquisition, and it now has 120k miles. Equipment includes the Sound Package Plus, a Cocoa soft top, 18″ Boxster S II wheels, a speed-dependent rear spoiler, heated seats, and cruise control. This 987.2 Boxster is now offered in Ohio by the selling dealer at no reserve with a clean Pennsylvania title.",
      "The car is finished in Carrara White and features a power-operated Cocoa convertible top. Additional equipment includes roll bars, a speed-dependent rear spoiler, silver-accented quarter panel intakes, and a central exhaust outlet. The Carfax report notes that the rear of the car sustained “minor damage” in April 2018 with no additional information provided. The right-front side marker lens was replaced in preparation for the sale. The front bumper cover has scrapes, and the right-rear stone guard is cracked.",
      "This is a relist after the vehicle was previously sold on BaT in July 2024 and the winning bidder failed to follow through with their commitment to purchase. This was not due to any fault with the vehicle. The winner’s participation on BaT has been restricted and their buyer’s fee was not refunded.",
      "The 18″ Boxster S II wheels have blemishes and wear Michelin Pilot Sport All Season 4 tires measuring 235/40 up front and 265/40 out back with 2021 date codes. The car is equipped with Porsche Stability Management (PSM), and braking is handled by four-piston Porsche-branded calipers over cross-drilled rotors measuring 11.7″ and 11.8″ front and rear, respectively.",
      "The cabin features heated seats upholstered in Sand Beige leather along with a color-coordinated dashboard and carpets. Amenities include the Sound Package Plus, a wind deflector, automatic climate control, and cruise control. The driver’s door trim is worn and both door release handles have missing finish.",
      "The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a central 8k-rpm tachometer, a 175-mph speedometer, and gauges for fuel level and coolant temperature. The digital odometer indicates 120k miles.",
      "The mid-mounted 2.9L flat-six is located ahead of the rear cargo area and was factory rated at 255 horsepower and 214 lb-ft of torque.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed manual transaxle.",
      "The Carfax report notes the aforementioned damage entry."

      "This custom pickup was assembled under prior ownership using the cab from a 1953 Chevrolet 3100, a flatbed, and the chassis, suspension, and axles from a 1949 Chevrolet 3600. The truck is finished in Jet Black over black vinyl and is powered by a 216ci inline-six paired with a four-speed manual transmission. Equipment includes 16″ steel wheels with hubcaps, running boards, and wood bed stakes. This custom Chevrolet pickup was purchased by the seller in 2024 and is now offered at no reserve with parts receipts and a clean Minnesota title in the seller’s name, listing it as a 1953 Chevrolet 3100.",
      "The 1953 3100 cab and wood-lined flatbed were mounted on a frame reportedly sourced from a 1949 3600 under prior ownership, and the exterior was repainted black. Equipment includes running boards, turn signals, and wood bed stakes. The windshield, rear window, and door glass was replaced in 2022. The seller states that the paint is dull and aged in areas, and there are dents throughout the body and fenders.",
      "The eight-lug 16″ steel wheels wear Chevrolet-branded hubcaps and were mounted with 7.50-16 Deestone tires in 2024. The suspension and axles were reportedly sourced from the Chevrolet 3600. The four-wheel drum brakes were reportedly overhauled in 2021.",
      "The cab houses green-finished metal surfaces along with a bench seat that was fitted with replacement padding and reupholstered in black vinyl in 2022. A replacement headliner was installed the following year. Interior appointments include a glovebox, an aftermarket turn signal switch, and a cabin heater.",
      "Instrumentation consists of a 90-mph speedometer and auxiliary gauges for coolant temperature, fuel level, oil pressure, and amperage. The five-digit odometer shows 100 miles, approximately 50 of which were added under current ownership. The gauges are inaccurate and total mileage is unknown.",
      "The 216ci inline-six was factory rated at 92 horsepower and 176 lb-ft of torque. Work in 2021 reportedly included replacing the heater motor, engine mounts, throttle and choke cables, wiring harness, ignition coil, radiator hoses, oil lines and pan gasket, and fuel level sending unit. The carburetor is said to have been rebuilt in 2022, at which time the fuel tank and lines were replaced. A replacement battery was installed in 2024.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a four-speed manual transmission. The seller notes rust on the underbody along with leaks from the engine oil pan and the rear axle.",
      "The truck is titled as a 1953 Chevrolet 3100 using the serial number from the cab, H53J026511. The seller states that a stamping is not visible on the frame.",
      "The Minnesota title is listed as a duplicate."

Work under current ownership is said to have involved inspecting the valve clearances and replacing the tires. This Monster 1100 is offered at no reserve with a key code card, two keys, a battery charger and tester, and a clean California title in the seller’s name.",
      "The motorcycle is finished in black. Features include a dual-bulb rounded headlight assembly, an aftermarket rear fender eliminator kit, folding passenger foot pegs, a two-up seat with a removable rear cowl, and a side stand. Scratches are noted on the left side of the 3.8-gallon fuel tank.",

Suspension consists of a Showa 43mm inverted fork in addition to a Sachs monoshock attached to the single-sided swingarm. The triple disc brakes feature four-piston Brembo calipers fitted over a pair of 320mm drilled floating rotors up front as well as a two-piston caliper paired with a drilled rotor at the rear.",
      "The silver-finished alloy handlebar is mounted aft of a digital instrument panel, which includes a speedometer, an arcing bar-style 12k-rpm tachometer, and a coolant temperature gauge. The digital odometer indicates 4,600 miles, approximately 2k of which were ridden by the seller.",
      "The air-cooled 1,078cc L-twin features an electric starter and a desmodromic valvetrain. The valve clearances were checked in 2020, at which time the oil and the air filter were changed. The seller states that a Candela Manufacturing two-into-two exhaust system was installed in May 2021, while a Rexxer engine control unit (ECU) tune was applied and the battery was replaced in September 2021.",
      "Power is routed to the rear wheel through a six-speed transmission and a drive chain.",

      "This 1970 Honda CL175 Scrambler was purchased by the seller in 2020, reportedly following time with two previous owners in Washington State. Finished in Candy Orange, it is powered by a four-stroke 174cc parallel twin paired with a five-speed transmission. Equipment includes a chrome high-mount exhaust system, a kick starter, dual Keihin carburetors, 19″ and 18″ wire-spoke wheels, and drum brakes as well as trail lighting, a steering damper, high-mounted fenders, a side stand, and a black vinyl-upholstered two-up seat. The seller reports vapor-blasting the carburetors in 2022 along with resealing the forks, changing the engine oil, and replacing the battery, front tire, petcock, fuel line, and hand levers. This CL175K3A is now offered at no reserve with a tool kit and a Washington title in the seller’s name.",
      "The bike is finished in Candy Orange and is equipped with a 2.5-gallon fuel tank that was internally sealed under prior ownership. Additional bike details include high-mounted fenders, front and rear lighting, folding passenger foot pegs, a side stand, and a black vinyl-upholstered two-up seat. Photos showing a ding in the right side of the tank are provided in the gallery below.",
      "Wire-spoke wheels with 19″ front and 18″ rear chromed steel rims wear a 2.75″ Shinko tire up front that was mounted in 2022 along with an older 3.50″ Cheng Shin tire out back. Suspension consists of a telescopic leading-axle fork that was resealed by the seller as well as dual preload-adjustable Showa shocks mounted to the swingarm. Braking is handled by front and rear drums, with the former featuring twin leading shoes.",
      "The chrome cross-braced handlebar carries a single mirror and replacement levers, and it is secured ahead of a steering-damper adjuster. Nippon Seiki instrumentation consists of a 110-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 10,500-rpm redline. The five-digit odometer shows 1,700 miles, approximately 25 of which were ridden under current ownership.",
      "The four-stroke 174cc parallel twin is equipped with a kick starter, dual Keihin carburetors, and a chrome high-mounted exhaust system with a shielded muffler and runners. Factory-rated output was 20 horsepower and 11 lb-ft of torque. The seller reports vapor-blasting the carburetors in 2022 as well as changing the oil and replacing the battery, petcock, and fuel line.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheel through a five-speed transmission and a drive chain.",
      "A tool kit will accompany the motorcycle.",
      "The motorcycle’s Washington title carries a Classic brand."

Equipment includes 15″ wide-five alloy wheels, front disc brakes, aluminum drum covers, dual EMPI carburetors, a 009-style distributor, and a sidewinder-style center-exit exhaust system with heater boxes in addition to a wood-rimmed steering wheel, Coco mats, a wind deflector, Crow Enterprizes lap belts, and a hidden Bluetooth stereo system. This 356 replica is now offered with service records and a clean California title in the seller’s name describing it as a 1963 SPCN.",
      "The fiberglass body is mounted over a modified Volkswagen Beetle chassis and is finished in Mexico Blue with black #9 racing numbers and graphics. Exterior details include a black soft top and side curtains leather hood straps, driving lights, mesh headlight grilles, gold-finished Porsche and Carrera badging, Spyder-style mirrors, a reproduction Reutter badge on the right fender, a GT-style louvered decklid, and beehive taillights. An additional pair of glass side windows are included in the sale. Paint chips are present on the front end.",

      "The wood-rimmed steering wheel wears a Porsche crest horn button and frames a central tachometer flanked by a 130-mph speedometer and a combination gauge monitoring engine temperature and fuel level. The five-digit mechanical odometer shows 20k miles, approximately 15k of which have been added under current ownership.",

    "description": [
      "This 1963 Triumph TR4 was modified as a race car in the mid-1960s and has been campaigned in SCCA events over the years. Power is supplied by a 2,138cc inline-four mated with a four-speed manual transmission with overdrive and close-ratio gears along with a Southwick rear axle conversion with a Detroit locker with 4.10:1 gearing. It is finished in white with blue and red stripes over a race-prepped interior housing a roll cage, a single racing seat with harnesses, AutoMeter gauges, and a Grant GT steering wheel. Additional equipment includes aftermarket 15″ wheels, an aluminum radiator, an Accusump oil accumulator and oil cooler, a fuel cell, adjustable coilovers, and four-wheel disc brakes with dual master cylinders. The car was acquired by the current owner in 2016 and has been converted to left-hand drive since it was previously listed on BaT in December 2018. This TR4 is now offered by the seller on behalf of the current owner in Pennsylvania with fiberglass body panels, an SCCA log book, and a bill of sale.",
      "The Giovanni Michelotti-designed body was repainted white with blue and red stripes and #37 livery in 2017. The bumpers, headlights, and windshield have been removed, while additional equipment includes a fender-mounted left mirror, hood and trunk pins, DZUS fasteners, and an electrical cutoff switch. Fiberglass body panels accompany the vehicle.",
      "The 15″ aftermarket wheels are mounted with 205/60 Hoosier Speedsters tires. Braking is handled by four-wheel discs utilizing Tilton dual master cylinders, TR4A front calipers and rotors, Saab 9000 rear rotors and Wilwood four-piston calipers, and a Tilton proportioning valve. The front suspension incorporates adjustable upper A-arms, Koni shocks, aftermarket springs, a sway bar, and Delrin bushings while the four-link rear setup features heim joints, Koni adjustable coilovers, and a panhard bar.",
      "The cabin has been stripped and houses an eight-point roll cage with door bars surrounding an aluminum racing seat with harnesses. A fire suppression system is installed. The car was converted to left-hand drive since the last auction.",
      "The Grant GT steering wheel frames a custom dash housing AutoMeter gauges including a tachometer and auxiliary instrumentation. There is no speedometer or odometer installed and total mileage is unknown.",
      "The 2,138cc inline four was reportedly built in January 2018 with a Moldex steel crankshaft, forged pistons, Carrillo rods, a racing camshaft, and a reworked cylinder head. The nine-quart oiling system uses a three-quart Accusump and an oil cooler ducted through one of the headlamp openings. Cooling is through a Griffin aluminum radiator supplemented by driver-controlled electric fans. An eight-gallon fuel cell is located in the trunk, and twin electric fuel pumps supply the dual SU carburetors.",
      "Power is routed to the rear wheels through a four-speed manual transmission that features a later ribbed case and overdrive in all four gears. An aluminum flywheel is joined by a Tilton pressure plate and custom hydraulic throw-out bearing. The Southwick rear axle conversion incorporates a Detroit locker with a 4.10:1 final drive ratio.",
      "There is no chassis number on the vehicle, and it is not registered, titled, or legal for road use. It is being sold on a bill of sale."

    "description": [
      "This 1978 Kawasaki Z1-R underwent a one-year refurbishment that was completed in April 2019, only two weeks before the 14th annual Quail Motorcycle Gathering in Carmel, California, where it placed second in the Japanese class. The bike is powered by a 1,015cc inline-four paired with a five-speed transmission and is finished in silver over a black double-cradle frame. Equipment includes a quarter-fairing, a stepped two-up seat with a rear cowl, 18″ cast alloy wheels, triple disc brakes, quad Mikuni carburetors, an electric starter, and a chrome four-into-two-into-one exhaust system with a reverse-cone megaphone muffler. This D1 Z1-R was acquired by the seller in September 2020 and is now offered with a clean Wyoming title in the seller’s name.",
      "The bike features a fiberglass quarter-fairing, a steel 3.4-gallon fuel tank and front fender, and an ABS plastic ducktail cowl and side panels that were refinished in Metallic Stardust Silver with blue and black pinstriping during the refurbishment. Additional equipment includes a black-painted double-cradle frame and a stepped two-up seat with a grab strap as well as a tinted windscreen, a chrome lift-assist handle, folding passenger foot pegs, and both center and side stands.",
      "Seven-spoke 18″ cast alloy wheels are finished in black with bright edges and mounted with Phoenix E70P front and Dunlop Gold Seal K87 Mark II rear tires. Suspension is handled by a 36mm telescopic fork as well as a pair of preload-adjustable shocks mounted to a swingarm that pivots on needle bearings. Braking is provided by dual 296mm drilled discs up front and a single 290mm drilled disc at the rear. All three brake calipers and both master cylinders were rebuilt during the refurbishment.",
      "A chrome handlebar equipped with a pair of black-finished mirrors fronts a dash panel housing a 160-mph Nippon Denso speedometer, a matching tachometer with an 8,500-rpm redline, a fuel-level gauge, an ammeter, and a vertical bank of warning lamps. The five-digit odometer shows 18 miles, though true mileage is unknown.",
      "The 1,015cc DOHC inline-four was factory rated at 90 horsepower and is equipped with four 28mm VM-series Mikuni carburetors, an electric starter, and a chrome four-into-two-into-one exhaust system with a reverse-cone megaphone muffler. An overhaul of the engine during the refurbishment included replacing and honing the cylinders, replacing the piston rings, and fitting a replacement wiring harness from another Z1-R. Re-chroming the exhaust system was a process that is said to have involved cutting the pipes into pieces and rewelding them using the same process as the factory.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheel through a five-speed transmission and a drive chain.",
      "The bike is accompanied by an owner’s manual and a Kawasaki tool kit that are stowed in the tail section as well as an emergency kick-start lever that is secured by a bracket to the seat pan."

      "This 2006 Jeep Wrangler SE was first delivered to Dodge of Winter Haven in Florida, and it has 32k miles following registration history in the state. It remained in the care of its original owner until it was purchased by the seller’s parents in 2008, and it was acquired by the seller in 2024. Finished in Midnight Blue over dark slate gray vinyl, the truck is powered by a 2.4-liter inline-four linked with a six-speed manual transmission and a dual-range Command-Trac transfer case. Equipment includes chrome-finished tubular bumpers and side step bars as well as 15″ Ravine aluminum wheels, a soft top, metal half doors, air conditioning, a fold-and-tumble rear bench, power steering, high-back front bucket seats, a roll bar, and a Bluetooth-capable Alpine stereo. This TJ Wrangler is now offered with a window sticker, the owner’s manual, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Florida title in the seller’s name.",
      "The truck is finished in Midnight Blue, and exterior equipment includes metal half doors,   dual side mirrors, a swing-out tailgate, and chrome-finished tubular bumpers and side step bars. The replacement soft top was reportedly fitted about a year ago. Close-up photos of finish imperfections are included in the gallery.",
      "The 15″ Ravine aluminum wheels are fitted with Cooper Discoverer RTX tires, and a full-size spare is mounted to a swing-out rear carrier. Curb marks and corrosion are present on the wheels. Stopping power is provided by front discs and rear drums. The truck came factory equipped with a Quadra-Coil multi-link suspension with live solid axles. The rear bump stops were reportedly replaced in preparation for the sale.",
      "The cabin features high-back front bucket seats upholstered in dark slate gray vinyl with color-coordinated door panels and carpets. Amenities include a fold-and-tumble rear bench, a roll bar, a mini-floor console with a cup holder, air conditioning, a locking glovebox, and an Alpine CD stereo with Bluetooth connectivity.",
      "The steering wheel frames a 100-mph speedometer, a tachometer, and gauges for fuel level, voltage, coolant temperature, and oil pressure. The digital odometer indicates 32k miles, approximately 100 of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The 2.4-liter inline-four was rated at 147 horsepower and 165 lb-ft when new. The battery was replaced in preparation for the sale.",
      "Power is sent to the rear or all four wheels through a six-speed manual transmission and a dual-range Command-Trac transfer case. The clutch interlock switch was reportedly replaced in June 2024. Corrosion is evident on the underbody.",
      "The window sticker lists initial delivery to Dodge of Winter Haven in Florida, along with factory equipment, colors, and a total price of $19,945.",
      "The Carfax report is free from accidents or other reported damage."

      "This 1968 Chevrolet Corvair 500 Sport Coupe was modified as a race car approximately eight years ago under prior ownership and was later used in NASA-sanctioned track days as well as VDCA and SVRA events. The car was purchased by the seller on BaT in August 2022. Power is from a flat-six that has been increased in displacement to 3.0 liters and paired with a close-ratio four-speed manual gearbox. The car is finished in yellow with black stripes and features a roll cage with door bars, front and rear spoilers, a trunk-mounted fuel cell, Kirkey fixed-back bucket seats, front and rear sway bars, uprated springs, and 15” Aero wheels. This Corvair race car is now offered at no reserve in Kentucky with a clean Michigan title in the seller’s name.",
      "Finished from the factory in Ermine White (C), the car was repainted its current shade of yellow with black stripes during the build. The bumpers, trim, side windows, and inner taillights have been removed, and #76 roundels have been added to the quarter panels and hood. Additional modifications include rear window straps, Lexan rear quarter windows, hood pins, front and rear lip spoilers, a custom air duct on the rear decklid, an intake grille in the lower front end for the oil cooler, and brake cooling ducts in place of the inner headlights.",
      "Black-painted 15” Aero wheels feature yellow pinstripes and are mounted with 225/50 Toyo Proxes R888R tires. Braking is via front discs and rear drums. The car is reportedly fitted with uprated springs along with Crown front and rear sway bars with custom mounts and links.",
      "The stripped cabin is finished in off-white and houses a full roll cage with door bars as well as two black fabric-upholstered Kirkey fixed-back bucket seats. Equipment includes a wide-angle multi-pane rearview mirror, a window net, fire extinguisher and brake balance valve mounted between the seats, and Simpson multi-point harnesses, which expired in June 2022.",
      "The three-spoke steering wheel with a quick-release sits ahead of a custom instrument panel housing an 8k-rpm Sunpro tachometer and auxiliary displays for cylinder head temperature, oil temperature, and air/fuel ratio. The center stack features toggle switches for vehicle functions. No odometer is fitted, thus total mileage is unknown.",
      "The front trunk contains a Jaz Products fuel cell, a Holley electric fuel pump, lines from the front-mounted oil cooler, and ducting for the front brakes. The Optima battery was installed by the seller.",
      "The replacement flat-six reportedly displaces 3.0 liters and was built in 2006 by LeVair Performance, during which time it was fitted with tri-ported heads. The engine was upgraded by the seller in 2021 with parts sourced from Auto-Bohn engines of Lowell, Michigan, that included custom cylinders, 92mm Wiseco pistons, Offenhauser-branded valve covers, angle-ported exhaust tubes with Porsche-spec exhaust manifolds, an aftermarket dual exhaust system, and an electronic distributor. A replacement carburetor was installed under current ownership and is said to need tuning prior to track use. Additional modifications are said to include the following components:",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels via a four-speed manual transaxle with close-ratio third and fourth gears."

Equipment includes a black soft top, an aluminum chassis, pushrod suspension, 18″ three-piece wheels, Borla mufflers, heated mirrors, air conditioning, and a Delco Monsoon CD/cassette stereo. This Shelby Series 1 has 7,600 miles and is now offered in Naples, Florida, with a clean Montana title in the name of the seller’s LLC.",

The aluminum chassis is paired with carbon-fiber and fiberglass laminate bodywork, which is finished in Centennial Silver Metallic on this example. Exterior equipment includes a black soft top in addition to front fog lamps, a front-hinged heat extractor hood, fender vents, heated side-view mirrors, a Le Mans-style fuel filler, and a dual-outlet Borla exhaust.",
      "The three-piece 18″ five-spoke wheels wear Shelby center caps and are mounted with older front 265/40 Goodyear Eagle F1 Supercar tires as well as 315/40 Nitto N1 rear rubber. The Shelby Series 1 features pushrod suspension with inboard-mounted coilovers and remote reservoir dampers. Braking is provided by Shelby-branded four-piston calipers mounted over vented discs at all four corners.",

Additional interior appointments include a carbon-fiber shift knob, power windows, Shelby-branded floor mats, a CD stereo, a Monsoon sound system, and air conditioning. Separation of the dash from the center stack and wear on the driver’s door panel are noted.",

      "This 1959 Alfa Romeo 2000 Spider was built on December 19, 1958, and delivered new to the US through the Hoffman Motor Company of New York. One of a claimed 3,443 examples, chassis 00072 underwent a multi-year rotisserie refurbishment that was completed in 2010 and was subsequently displayed at the 2021 Concorso Italiano in Seaside, California, where it won Sports Car Market’s Best Tipo 102 award. The car is finished in white with a black Stayfast soft top and an aftermarket black hardtop, while the cabin has been re-trimmed in tan leather and retrofitted with a vintage-style radio and an aftermarket stereo. Power comes from a replacement 2.3L twin-cam inline-four fitted with a custom-fabricated intake manifold, twin Weber 45DCOE carburetors, and modified camshafts. Shifting is through a five-speed manual transmission, and further equipment includes finned drum brakes, Koni shocks, and 400mm steel wheels. The car was sold on BaT in August 2021 and was listed again on the site in March 2022 before being acquired by the current owner later that year. This 2000 Spider is now offered on dealer consignment with a spare 2.0L twin-cam inline-four along with tools and spare parts along with a clean Pennsylvania title.",
      "The 2000 Spider featured bodywork by Carrozzeria Touring of Milan, Italy, and the US-market version can be differentiated by closely-paired hood scoops divided by a single trim piece as well as a single chrome strip along each rocker panel. This example was delivered from the factory in Grigio Biacca (AR 702), and it was stripped, mounted to a rotisserie, underwent rust repair, and fitted with several replacement body panels before it was repainted in its current white finish as part of the aforementioned refurbishment.

      "This 1948 Chris-Craft Deluxe is a 17′ wood runabout that is powered by an inboard 236ci inline-six driving a single prop through a forward/reverse transmission. A replacement transom, hull framing, and planks are said to have been fitted as part of a refurbishment under previous ownership in 1995, and the boat was subsequently acquired by the seller on BaT in May 2022. Features include a two-row cockpit with red vinyl seating, polished stainless-steel and chrome hardware, a two-piece windscreen, a spotlight, a bilge pump, and an updated electrical system with a battery cutoff switch. The accompanying single-axle trailer features a manual winch, a rolling tongue jack, and guide-ons. Classy Lady was listed on BaT in July 2024 and is now offered at no reserve in Florida with a green boat cover as well as a clean Illinois title for the boat and a bill of sale for the trailer.",
      "The wood hull was reportedly refurbished under previous ownership in 1995 with a replacement transom, framing, and planks, and the seller states a non-soak 5200 bottom is installed. The boat features white upper deck caulking as well as a two-piece windscreen, an aluminum air cleaner cover, a spotlight, and a polished cutwater and other brightwork. A spot of wood rot measuring approximately a half-inch across is noted on one of the ribs.",
      "The cockpit houses two bench seats that were reupholstered in marbled red vinyl in 2014. Further details include a wooden dash, a chrome gear selector, white textured flooring, and gunwale storage pockets as well as front and rear step plates.",
      "The two-spoke steering wheel features a throttle lever and sits ahead of a reverse-sweep tachometer as well as a combination ammeter and oil pressure gauge. A temperature gauge is mounted below the dash. The boat is not equipped with an hour meter, and total runtime is unknown.",
      "The triple-carbureted 236ci Chris-Craft/Hercules KBL inline-six produced 131 horsepower when new. A bilge pump has been fitted along with a 12-volt electrical system featuring a battery cutoff switch.",
      "The engine turns a single propeller via a forward-reverse transmission.",
      "The Chris-Craft data plate is shown above, and a photo of the engine plate in the gallery lists the model, serial number, firing order, and recommended oil viscosity. The Illinois title lists the hull number as R17169 vs. R171769 listed on the data plate."

      "This 1997 Land Rover Defender 110 is a left-hand-drive example that is said to have been acquired by the selling dealer in 2021 and refurbished in Italy during work completed in 2024. Finished in green over quilted tan leather upholstery, it is powered by a 2.5-liter 300Tdi turbodiesel inline-four linked to a five-speed manual transmission, a dual-range transfer case, and a locking center differential. Equipment includes a beige Exmoor Trim Stayfast soft top, LED exterior lighting, and body-color 16″ steel wheels. The truck also has air conditioning, a rearview camera, a Pioneer head unit, Hertz speakers, a wood-rimmed Exmoor steering wheel, teak cargo-area flooring, and inward-facing jump seats. Imported to the US in 2024, this Defender 110 shows 81k kilometers (~50k miles) and is offered by the selling dealer with a clean Carfax report and a clean Florida title that lists the truck as a 1998 model year.",
      "The truck is said to have been disassembled and repainted during the refurbishment, reportedly in Grasmere Green. The previously installed hardtop and rear door have been removed, and a beige Exmoor Trim Stayfast soft top and a drop-down tailgate have been added. Other exterior features include LED lighting, checker-plate trim, black wheel arch flares, mud flaps, fold-down side steps, and a tow ball.",
      "Body-color 16″ steel wheels are mounted with BFGoodrich Trail-Terrain T/A tires, and a matching spare is secured to a swing-out carrier at the rear of the truck. The brake booster was overhauled and the brake vacuum pump was replaced during the refurbishment, at which time the shocks and front brake rotors were replaced according to the seller.",
      "The cabin features front bucket seats and inward-facing jump seats trimmed in tan leather with quilted stitching that extends to the dash, door panels, and shifter boots. The bulkhead behind the front seats has been removed, and custom teak wood flooring has been added to the cargo area. Other details include LED interior lighting, aluminum shift knobs, a Pioneer touchscreen head unit linked with a rearview camera, and a custom sound system with an amplifier, a subwoofer, and 150-watt Hertz marine-grade speakers. Air conditioning was installed in 2024 according to the seller.",
      "The wood-rimmed Exmoor steering wheel fronts a 150-km/h speedometer, a clock, and gauges for coolant temperature and fuel level. The six-digit odometer shows 81k kilometers (~50k miles), approximately 750 kilometers of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The 2.5-liter 300Tdi turbodiesel inline-four sends power to all four wheels through a five-speed manual transmission, a dual-range transfer case, and a locking center differential. Work during the refurbishment is said to have included an oil change and the replacement of the clutch assembly, rear axle, distributor, and water pump.",
      "The frame is said to have been repainted during the refurbishment, and additional underside photos are provided in the gallery below.",
      "The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage."

      "This 1972 Husqvarna 125 CR is powered by a 124cc two-stoke single paired with a six-speed transmission and is finished in yellow over a silver frame. Features include a high-mounted expansion-chamber exhaust system, 21″ front and 18″ rear alloy rims, aluminum fenders, a cross-braced handlebar, a side stand, and knobby Pirelli tires. This 125 CR was acquired by the seller in 2021 and is now offered at no reserve in California for off-road use only with a bill of sale.",
      "The bike is finished in yellow with polished fuel tank knee panels and white accents. It also features white number plates, a side stand, aluminum fenders, a black vinyl solo seat, and a silver-painted single-downtube frame. The seller notes chips in the paint and damage on the front number plate, and a photo showing the inside of the fuel tank can be viewed in the gallery.",

      "The chrome cross-braced handlebar is secured by four-bolt risers. No instrumentation is present, therefore total mileage is unknown.",
      "The 124cc two-stroke single produced 20 horsepower when new and is equipped with an Amal carburetor and an expansion chamber exhaust system. The carburetor and ignition system were serviced in February 2024. One of the engine bolts displays corrosion.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheel through a wet clutch, a six-speed transmission, and a drive chain.",

    "description": [
      "This 1976 BMW R90/6 was the subject of a custom build that began in 2018 and involved repainting the bodywork in black with gold pinstripes, powder-coating the frame and related components, fitting a 1,000cc big-bore kit to the air-cooled opposed-twin, and rebuilding the five-speed transmission and cylinder heads. The modified engine features a pair of Dell’Orto carburetors and a two-into-two exhaust system with Hoske mufflers, and the bike is further equipped with a black vinyl two-up seat, an aftermarket upper triple clamp housing motogadget instrumentation, clip-on handlebars, LED turn signals, 19″ and 18″ wire-spoke wheels, dual front disc brakes, Hagon rear shocks, and both center and side stands. The bike was sold on BaT in June 2022 and acquired by the current owner later in that same year. This custom-built R90/6 is now offered on dealer consignment with a clean California title.",
      "The bike was disassembled before the fuel tank and fenders were refinished in black with gold pinstripes and BMW roundel graphics as part of the aforementioned build. The frame and related hardware were powder-coated at that time, and stainless-steel fasteners are said to have been used during the reassembly process. A yellow headlight lens, a modified taillight, aftermarket LED turn signals, and aluminum rear-set foot controls have been added, and additional details include a black vinyl two-up seat, laser-engraved BMW badges on the swingarm caps, and both center and side stands.",
      "Wire-spoke wheels measuring 19″ up front and 18″ out back feature powder-coated rims and hubs as well as stainless-steel spokes and nipples. Dunlop Roadmaster tires are mounted at both wheels and stainless-steel axles are said to have been installed as part of the build. Suspension consists of a leading-axle fork with rubber gaiters that was rebuilt in 2018 as well as twin Hagon shocks mounted to the swingarm on the left and the final drive enclosure on the right. Spiegler stainless-steel brake lines feed a pair of single-piston calipers mounted over cross-drilled discs up front, while a drum provides stopping power at the rear.",
      "Joker Machine clip-on handlebars with bar-end mirrors are secured below the OSHMO upper triple-clamp, which houses a motogadget motoscope tiny 200-km/h speedometer with an inset digital display. True mileage is unknown. Replacement levers and switchgear have been installed. The seller notes that the odometer function resets every time the bike is turned on.",
      "The air-cooled opposed twin was fitted with a Siebenrock 1,000cc big-bore kit before the cylinder heads were rebuilt as part of the 2018 work. The crankcase, cylinders, and heads were painted black at that time, and the modified engine features dual 38mm Dell’Orto carburetors with pod-style air filters as well as an electric starter and a two-into-two exhaust system with heat-wrapped headers, a crossover pipe, and 38mm Hoske black chrome mufflers. The carburetors were cleaned and the battery was replaced in preparation for the sale.",
      "The five-speed transmission was rebuilt and the clutch assembly was replaced as part of the build. Power is delivered to the rear wheel via a driveshaft enclosed within the right leg of the swingarm."

      "This 1978 Ford F-100 Custom was purchased new by the seller’s father and is said to have been kept in storage since 2008. Power is from a 351ci V8 paired with a three-speed automatic transmission, and the truck is finished in black and silver over black and blue upholstery. Additional equipment includes 15″ American Racing wheels, a LoRider tonneau cover, tubular side steps, a sliding rear window, a receiver hitch, a power sunroof, an Alpine cassette stereo, power windows, and a trailer brake controller. The starter, battery, and fuel pump were replaced in preparation for the sale. This dentside F-100 is offered with the owner’s manual, service records, and British Columbia registration.",
      "The truck received a replacement rear box approximately 15-2o years ago per the seller, and has been repainted black and silver. Equipment includes a tow ball, a LoRider tonneau cover, a two-piece rubber bed mat, a power sunroof, a sliding rear window, and tubular side steps. The seller states a front fender has been replaced.",
      "The 15″ American Racing wheels are mounted with Michelin tires. Braking is handled by front discs and rear drums, and the truck is equipped with power steering. The seller states the tires need to be replaced. The seller states that two additional 15″ American Racing wheels are included in the sale.",
      "The bench seat is trimmed in black vinyl and blue patterned cloth. Amenities include an Alpine cassette stereo, power windows, and a trailer brake controller. The seller notes the truck has a locking hood latch that can be unlocked inside the cab using the ignition key.",
      "The three-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a 130-km/h speedometer and supplementary gauges. The five-digit odometer shows 83k kilometers (~52k miles) and has rolled over. Total mileage is unknown. The fuel gauge does not work.",
      "The 351ci V8 is equipped with an Edelbrock carburetor and valve covers. The starter, fuel pump, and battery were replaced in preparation for the sale.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels via a replacement three-speed automatic transmission. The truck has dual fuel tanks, and the seller recommends that one of them needs replacement due to a leak.",
      "The vehicle is being sold on its British Columbia registration, which serves as the ownership document in British Columbia, Canada. The sale does not include a title."

Features include back-to-back seating, a plexiglass windscreen, navigation lights, and a ski locker. This GT-150 is now offered at no reserve in Wisconsin with manufacturer’s literature, a Calkins single-axle trailer, a bill of sale for the trailer, and Wisconsin registration in the seller’s name for the boat.",

      "The Johnson 50ci Stinger 75 two-stroke triple was rated for 75 horsepower when new and sends power to a three-blade propeller. The water pump was replaced in 2023.",
      "The single-axle Calkins trailer has white-painted steel wheels, roller hull supports, a manual winch, and a rolling tongue jack.",
      "The boat does not have a title, as it is registered in a state that does not issue titles for boats of its length. It is being sold on its registration. The trailer does not have a title as Wisconsin does not issue titles or registration for trailers of its weight class and intended use. The trailer is being sold on a bill of sale."

      "This Backdraft Racing Roadster was assembled in July 2007 and acquired by the selling dealer in February 2024. It is powered by a Roush 402R V8 that is linked to a Tremec T56 six-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential and finished in black with silver center stripes over gray leather upholstery. Equipment includes 17″ Halibrand-style wheels, power-assisted disc brakes, four-wheel independent suspension, polished bumperettes, a single roll hoop, a wood-rimmed steering wheel, Crow Enterprizes racing harnesses, a Rockford Fosgate Bluetooth head unit, a Boss amplifier, CNC-ported aluminum cylinder heads, MSD ignition, an Edelbrock intake manifold, and a Holley carburetor. This RT3 Roadster is now offered by the selling dealer in Oregon with a copy of the Manufacturer’s Statement of Origin, manufacturer’s literature, service records, and a clean Florida title describing it as a 1965 ROAS.",
      "The fiberglass bodywork is finished in black with silver center stripes and is mounted over a black powder-coated steel frame. Exterior details include polished bumperettes, a hood scoop, fender vents, Raydot-style mirrors, wind wings, a single roll hoop, a LeMans-style fuel filler cap, and side-exit exhaust pipes.",
      "Halibrand-style 17″ wheels are secured with safety-wired three-eared knockoffs and are mounted with Goodyear Eagle F1 tires measuring 235/45 up front and 315/35 out back. The car is equipped with rack-and-pinion steering, adjustable coilovers, and four-wheel independent suspension sourced from an E36 BMW. Stopping power is provided by power-assisted four-wheel disc brakes with drilled rotors and red-finished calipers.",
      "The cockpit features low-back bucket seats upholstered in gray leather that extends to the dashboard and door panels as well as the parking brake and shifter boots. Interior details include an adjustable driver’s seat, a wood-rimmed steering wheel, a dashboard-mounted rearview mirror, tinted sunvisors, Crow Enterprizes racing harnesses, a Rockford Fosgate Bluetooth head unit, a Boss amplifier, and carpeted floor mats with embroidered Backdraft Racing logos.",
      "VDO instrumentation includes a 220-mph speedometer, a tachometer, and supplementary readouts for oil pressure, oil temperature, coolant temperature, battery voltage, and fuel level. The digital odometer shows 6k miles.",
      "The front-hinged hood opens to reveal a Roush 402R V8 that utilizes an iron two-bolt Ford Racing Sportsman block assembled with 10:1 compression ratio forged pistons, H-beam connecting rods, and a forged steel crankshaft. It has an estimated output of 518 horsepower and 500 lb-ft of torque. Additional engine details include CNC-ported aluminum cylinder heads, hydraulic roller lifters, a double roller timing set, MSD ignition, an Edelbrock intake manifold, and a Holley carburetor. Cooling is handled by an aluminum radiator with dual electric fans. Engine documentation outlining the specifications and power ratings is viewable in the gallery below. The starter and battery were replaced in March 2024 along with the carburetor needle and seat for the rear bowl. The valve cover gaskets were replaced in April 2024.",
      "Power is delivered to the rear wheels through a Tremec T56 six-speed manual transmission fitted with an SFI-rated steel bell housing and a limited-slip differential. The transmission was fitted with a replacement 5th gear and carbon fiber synchro rings in June 2024.",
      "An identification tag affixed to the firewall identifies this car as a Backdraft Roadster that was assembled by TR-Tec in South Africa. The current Florida title describes the car as a 1965 ROAS using the VIN AA9BMAAHV71CN1075, shown above."

      "This 1969 Ford Bronco spent more than 50 years in California with its previous owner, and the seller bought it out of storage in 2022. Refurbishment work began in 2023 and included rebuilding the 302ci V8 and installing a C4 three-speed automatic transmission and a twin-stick transfer case. Equipment includes a Weiand intake manifold, a COMP Cams camshaft, and a Holley carburetor. The body was refinished in green, a roll cage was installed, and the interior was refreshed with brown upholstery and two-tone door panels. The truck also has front bucket seats, three-point seat belts, and a Bluetooth head unit housed in the padded center console along with a Bilstein lift kit, Boyd Coddington 17″ wheels, and front disc brakes. This Bronco is now offered on dealer consignment with refurbishment photos, partial records, and a clean California title.",
      "The cab roof was removed as part of the build, and the truck was refinished in green. The roll cage, front grille, tire carrier, and bumpers are finished in white.",
      "Boyd Coddington 17″ wheels are wrapped in 265/65 BFGoodrich All-Terrain T/A tires, and a matching spare is mounted to the rear carrier. A Bilstein 2.5″ lift kit is installed. The truck is equipped with manually locking Warn front hubs, power steering, and front disc brakes.",
      "The cabin houses adjustable front bucket seats and a fold-and-tumble rear bench trimmed in brown upholstery, which is complemented by two-tone door panels and a painted dashboard. Three-point front seat belts are installed, and a Bluetooth head unit is housed in the padded center console.",
      "The aftermarket steering wheel is adorned with woodgrain trim and mounted on an Ididit tilting column. Instrumentation includes a 100-mph speedometer surrounded by auxiliary readouts, while a tachometer is mounted to the lower dashboard. The five-digit odometer shows 1,200 miles. Total mileage is unknown.",
      "The 302ci V8 was overhauled and bored .040″ over in March 2024. It is fitted with a COMP Cams camshaft, a Weiand intake manifold, and a Holley 600 cfm carburetor. A Haywire wiring harness is installed.",
      "Power is sent to the rear or all four wheels through a C4 three-speed automatic transmission and a dual-range transfer case with twin-stick shifters. The transmission was overhauled as part of the work that was completed in 2024."

      "This 1995 Porsche 911 Carrera coupe wears a Viola Metallic-tinted STEK paint-protection film over black paint, and the interior features Marble Grey all-leather seats. Bilstein dampers and H&R springs have been added to achieve European-specification ride height, and power is from a 3.6-liter flat-six linked with a six-speed manual transaxle and an optional limited-slip differential. Other equipment includes 18″ hollow-spoke “Technology” wheels, a power-operated sunroof, cruise control, air conditioning, and a Porsche Classic stereo with Apple CarPlay. The car remained with its original owner until 2020 and was acquired by the seller on BaT in June 2024. This 993 Carrera coupe shows 25k miles and is offered with a clean Carfax report and a clean Washington title in the seller’s name.",
      "The car is finished in Black (L741), and Viola Metallic-tinted STEK DYNOshield paint-protection film was applied to the bodywork in October 2023, at which time the third brake light, mirrors, and door handles were painted to match. Exterior details include headlight washers, fog lights, power-adjustable mirrors, a power-operated sunroof, a speed-activated rear spoiler, and dual exhaust outlets. The rear-window wiper has been removed, and evidence of paintwork under prior ownership is noted.",
      "The 18″ Technology hollow-spoke wheels were added under current ownership, and they are mounted with Continental ExtremeContact Sport tires. Braking is handled by Porsche-branded calipers over cross-drilled rotors at all four corners, and the suspension has been adjusted to European-specification ride height via Bilstein shocks and H&R springs. The brake master cylinder was replaced in 2024.",
      "The Marble Grey all-leather seats have supple inserts and are complemented by a black dashboard and burgundy floor mats. A Porsche Classic stereo with Apple CarPlay was added under current ownership, while cruise control and air conditioning are other features.",
      "The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames VDO instrumentation including a central tachometer with a 6,800-rpm redline, a 180-mph speedometer, an analog clock, and gauges for oil pressure, oil temperature, oil level, and fuel level. The six-digit odometer shows 25k miles, a handful of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The air-cooled 3.6L flat-six was factory rated at 270 horsepower and 243 lb-ft of torque. An oil plug was replaced in October 2022 along with the engine-fan air duct. An oil change was performed in March 2024.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels via a six-speed manual transaxle and an optional limited-slip differential.",
      "Decoding the option sticker reveals the following information:",
      "The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage.",
      "The Washington title indicates that use tax was waived as a result of the owner receiving the vehicle as a gift."

      "This 1982 Yamaha XV920 Virago was acquired out of California by the seller in 2020 and was subsequently built as a custom cafe racer in a project that included resealing the 920cc V-twin, five-speed transmission, and carburetors. The frame was shaved and powder-coated, and custom subframe was fabricated, and additional modifications include a custom leather seat, a stainless-steel exhaust system, a Yamaha R1 front end, an Acewell gauge, rear-set foot controls, and a Motogadget Mo.Unit Blue. This XV920 cafe racer is offered at no reserve with a clean California title in the seller’s name.",
      "The modified XV750 fuel tank in finished in Volvo Denim Blue (723) while the frame was shaved and powder-coated black. Additional modifications include a custom subframe with a frenched-in Revival Cycles LED taillight with integrated turn signals as well as an LED headlight, Motogadget front turn signals, Tarozzi folding rear-set foot controls, and a custom leather seat. Photos showing blemishes on the fuel tank can be viewed in the gallery.",
      "Cast alloy wheels, the front of which is from a Yamaha R6, were powder-coated bronze chrome and are mounted with Dunlop Elite 4 tires during the build. The inverted Yamaha R1 fork was Cerakote-coated, and the front end features a modified triple clamp and dual R1 Brembo disc brakes with wave rotors. The rear end utilizes Triumph Speed Triple suspension components and a drum brake.",
      "Clip-on handlebars are mounted below the top triple clamp and front an Acewell 12k-rpm tachometer and a digital multifunction display. The electronics and wiring have been replaced and the bike has been fitted with a Motogadget Mo.Unit Blue. The ignition and the gas cap use the same key. The digital odometer shows 900 miles, though total mileage is unknown.",
      "The air-cooled 920cc SOHC V-twin is said to have to have been resealed along with the transmission and carburetors during the build. The carburetors were re-jetted to pair with the custom intake and the stainless-steel baffled exhaust system. A lithium-ion battery and an aftermarket CDI box have been fitted.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheel through a five-speed transmission and an enclosed driveshaft. The clutch and starter were replaced during the build.",
      "The partial frame number is shown above, and the bike is titled in California using the number JYA10L002CA018967.",
      "The motorcycle is titled in California by its 17-character VIN, which contains the nine characters stamped on the frame. However, the label that displayed all characters of the VIN was discarded when the frame was refinished."

The car is said to have remained with one family for more than three decades prior to the selling dealer’s 2024 acquisition. Equipment includes an Edelbrock Performer intake manifold, a black soft top, dual hood scoops, 14″ Cragar wheels, power steering, power-assisted drum brakes, a Pioneer CD stereo, and trunk-mounted amplifiers. This Firebird is now offered by the selling dealer in New York with a clean Tennessee title.",

The black soft top operates slowly and requires service. Replacement wheelwell moldings were installed in preparation for the sale.",

      "The three-spoke steering wheel frames a 120-mph speedometer and a fuel-level gauge. An aftermarket tachometer is mounted on the steering column, and a trio of readouts are located ahead of the shifter. The five-digit odometer shows 96k miles, approximately 50 of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The selling dealer notes that the 400ci V8 is equipped with a revised camshaft, a Weber carburetor, an Edelbrock Performer intake manifold, an aluminum radiator, and exhaust headers. Three Sunpro readouts are mounted in the engine bay.",
      "Power is routed to the rear wheels through a TH400 three-speed automatic transmission.",

      "This 2005 Ford GT is one of 2,022 built for the model year, and it was purchased by the seller in April 2010. The car is finished in Mark IV Red over Ebony leather and was factory optioned with red-finished brake calipers, painted White stripes, and a McIntosh stereo system. Power is supplied by a supercharged 5.4-liter V8 linked with a six-speed manual gearbox and a helical limited-slip differential. Additional equipment includes Brembo brakes, HID headlights, a front splitter, a rear diffuser, and air conditioning. This Ford GT has 1,900 miles and is now offered with a clean Carfax report and a clean Louisiana title in the seller’s name.",
      "The Camilo Pardo-designed GT was styled as an homage to the Le Mans-winning GT40 racing cars of the 1960s and features aluminum body panels over an extruded-aluminum space frame and roll-bonded floors. This example is one of 766 finished in Mark IV Red for the model year and features optional over-the-top white stripes and Ford GT graphics, HID headlights, fog lights, side air intakes, a vented hood, a front splitter, a rear diffuser, and a dual center-exit exhaust system.",
      "Painted cast aluminum wheels measure 18″ up front and 19″ out back and are mounted with Goodyear Eagle F1 Supercar tires. The Brembo braking system features optional red-painted four-piston monoblock calipers with cross-drilled and ventilated rotors that measure 14” up front and 13.2” out back.",
      "The cockpit is trimmed in Ebony leather, and rubber mats cover bare aluminum floors. Manually adjusted seats were designed by Sparco and feature carbon-fiber shells with GT40-style ventilation grommets and harness slots. The console on the center tunnel houses rotary climate controls, and amenities include a McIntosh CD stereo, air conditioning, remote keyless entry, and push-button ignition.",
      "The leather-wrapped steering wheel is affixed to a tilting and telescoping column ahead of the GT40-inspired instrument array consisting of a central tachometer with a 6,500-rpm redline and an offset 220-mph speedometer. Toggle-switch controls are positioned under additional gauges for coolant temperature, oil pressure, voltage, boost, and fuel level. The seller notes that the gauges were replaced in May 2023. The digital odometer indicates 1,900 miles, approximately 700 of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The mid-mounted 5.4-liter DOHC V8 features an aluminum block, cylinder heads, and pistons in addition to a Lysholm screw-type supercharger, a dry-sump lubrication system, and a water-to-air intercooler. Factory-rated output was 550 horsepower and 500 lb-ft of torque, which is sent to the rear wheels through a Ricardo six-speed manual transaxle and a helical limited-slip differential.",

      "This 1958 Austin-Healey 100-6 BN6 is a left-hand-drive, two-seat roadster that was built in July 1958 and dispatched to Vancouver, British Columbia in Canada. The car is said to have remained under the care of a single family from the early 1960s through 2017, during which time it underwent refurbishment work in the 1990s and after which it was acquired by the seller’s father. Finished in duotone Pacific Green and Florida Green, the car is powered by a 2.6-liter inline-six mated to a four-speed manual transmission with overdrive. Inside, beige leather trim is accompanied by a Smiths cabin heater, lap belts, and a push-button radio. Additional equipment includes a grey convertible top, a luggage rack, 15″ wire wheels, and four-wheel drum brakes. This BN6 is now offered in Canada by the seller on behalf of their father’s estate with a tonneau cover, sliding-window side curtains, an owner’s handbook, refurbishment records, a British Motor Industry Heritage Trust certificate, and Ontario registration in the father’s name that lists the vehicle’s model year as 1959.",
      "Finished from the factory in duotone Pacific Green and Florida Green, the car was mounted to a rotisserie as part of the aforementioned 1990s refurbishment, during which it underwent bodywork prior to being refinished by Reg Beer Coachbuilder Corp. of Bolton, Ontario, Canada. Exterior details include chrome bumpers with overriders as well as a hood scoop, dual fender-mounted side mirrors, a rear luggage rack, and twin exhaust tips. A grey convertible top is installed, and a grey tonneau cover along with sliding side windows will accompany the vehicle.",
      "Chrome-finished 15″ wire wheels are secured via two-eared knock-offs and mounted with 165-series Vredestein Sprint Classic tires. Braking is provided by four-wheel drums.",
      "The reupholstered cabin houses a pair of low-back bucket seats trimmed in leather with green piping complemented by a color-coordinated dashboard and door panels. Green carpeting lines the floors, and additional appointments include lap belts, a Smiths under-dash heater, a passenger-side grab handle, and a push-button radio. Imperfections in the trim are shown up close in the gallery below.",
      "The banjo-style steering wheel features a 100-6 horn button and fronts Smiths instrumentation that includes a 120-mph speedometer, a 6k-rpm tachometer, and auxiliary gauges monitoring oil pressure, water temperature, and fuel level. The five-digit odometer shows 66k miles, less than 10 of which have been added since 2020.",
      "The 2.6L inline-six was overhauled in the early 1980s and is equipped with twin SU carburetors. Output was rated at 117 horsepower and 149 lb-ft of torque when new. The radiator core has been rebuilt.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels via a four-speed manual transmission with an electrically actuated Laycock de Normanville overdrive unit.",
      "The British Motor Industry Heritage Trust certificate lists factory colors, equipment, and initial delivery to the Austin Motor Company (Canada) of Vancouver, British Columbia, along with a build date in July 1958. The certificate also notes a chassis number of BN6-LO/2065, whereas the chassis plate and the Ontario registration document list the VIN as BN6L92065.",
      "The vehicle does not have a title and is being sold on its Ontario registration, which serves as the ownership document in Ontario, Canada."

      "This 1965 Chevrolet Corvette convertible was purchased by the current owner in 1985 and refurbished in the same decade, which included installing an overhauled 396ci V8 linked with a four-speed manual transmission. Further refurbishments included repainting the car in red, reupholstering the black vinyl interior, and fitting a replacement clutch, flywheel, and clutch release fork. Equipment includes a removable red hardtop, 15″ Rally wheels, four-wheel disc brakes, a Weiand intake manifold, retractable headlights, chrome bumpers, dual exhaust outlets, a Delco radio, and a wood-rimmed steering wheel. This C2 convertible is now offered at no reserve by the seller on behalf of the current owner with service records and a clean California title.",
      "The fiberglass body left the factory finished in Rally Red (UU) and was repainted in 1988, at which time the chrome was re-plated. Additional details include a removable red hardtop, a driver-side mirror, a power-retractable antenna, flip-up headlights, fender vents, split chrome bumpers, and dual exhaust outlets exiting through the rear valance.",
      "The 15″ steel wheels are mounted with 215/70 BFGoodrich Touring T/A tires. The C2 was the first Corvette to offer fully independent suspension, with upper and lower control arms at the front and a three-link setup with a transverse leaf spring at the rear.

      "This 1985 Ford Mustang LX notchback is a Special Service Package (SSP) example powered by a Roush 347ci V8 crate engine that was fitted in 2003, and it is finished in black over replacement gray cloth upholstery. Equipment includes a five-speed manual transmission, a Centerforce clutch, an MSD tachometer adapter, Holley electronic fuel injection, JBA exhaust headers, a driver-side spotlight, grille-mounted red and blue lights, four-wheel disc brakes, and black-finished 15″ alloy wheels with chrome-finished hubcaps in addition to air conditioning, a JVC CD stereo, a Pilot steering wheel, a police scanner, and a Carson SC-407 radio and siren control unit. The car spent time in Oregon, Washington, California, and Arizona before it was acquired by the current owner in 2022. This Fox-body SSP is offered on dealer consignment with service records and an Arizona title.",
      "The car is finished in black with bright window trim, a driver-side spotlight, quadruple rectangular headlights, grille-mounted red and blue lights, three antennas, and aftermarket fog lights. The roof, decklid, and doors were repainted in November 2004, while the rear bumper cover was repaired and refinished in 2006. Photos show corrosion beneath the fuel filler door.",
      "Black-finished 15″ alloy wheels with chrome-finished hubcaps are wrapped in 225/60 Kumho Ecsta LX Platinum tires. The car is equipped with power steering, and stopping power is provided by four-wheel disc brakes.",
      "The front bucket seats and the rear bench seat have been reupholstered in gray cloth with patterned inserts, and the cabin features a color-coordinated dashboard and door panels. Appointments include air conditioning, power windows, a JVC CD stereo, and a police scanner. A Carson SC-407 siren control unit mounted beneath the dashboard features a wired microphone, public address and radio functionality, and siren controls.",
      "The Pilot three-spoke steering wheel fronts a 140-mph “Certified Calibration” speedometer, a tachometer, and gauges for coolant temperature, amperage, oil pressure, and fuel level. The five-digit odometer shows 33k miles, approximately 2k of which were added under current ownership. The Carfax report lists a potential odometer rollover in October 2000 along with “not actual mileage” and “exceeds mechanical limits” title issuances beginning in June 2003. Total mileage is unknown.",
      "The Roush 347ci V8 crate engine was installed in 2003, and it has been fitted with Holley HP electronic fuel injection in addition to JBA exhaust headers. The selling dealer notes that a replacement distributor and an MSD tachometer adapter were fitted in 2024, at which time a replacement fuel tank was installed.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a Centerforce clutch and a five-speed manual transmission.",
      "The Carfax report shows the aforementioned potential odometer rollover and “not actual mileage” and “exceeds mechanical limits” title issuances, and it lists history in Oregon, Washington, California, and Arizona from its initial entry in February 1992.",
      "The Arizona title carries an “Exceeds Mechanical Limits” odometer notation."

      "This 1976 Cadillac Eldorado Convertible is said to have been purchased new by a member of the seller’s family and is currently owned by the seller’s grandmother. It is powered by a 500ci V8 paired with a three-speed automatic transmission and finished in red metallic over red leather. Equipment includes a white convertible soft top, 15″ steel wheels, black wheel covers, power steering, four-wheel disc brakes, a power-adjustable front seat, cruise control, power windows, a push-button AM/FM stereo, and a CB radio. This Eldorado Convertible is offered by the seller on behalf of their grandmother with an owner’s manual, a two-piece parade boot, and a clean Montana title.",
      "The car is finished in red metallic with white pinstriping and features a power-operated white convertible soft top, a power antenna, chrome bumpers, fender-mounted light monitors, and a remote-controlled left mirror with a thermometer. The seller notes stains on the soft top, touch-up paint on the rear quarter panels, and paint chips around the body.",
      "The 15″ steel wheels wear black covers and are mounted with 235/75 BFGoodrich Advantage Plus narrow-whitewall tires. The Eldorado featured a torsion bar front suspension and a coil-sprung solid rear axle along with Automatic Level Control and power steering. Braking is handled by power-assisted discs at all four corners.",
      "The power-adjustable front bench seat and rear bench are trimmed in red leather and joined by a color-coordinated dashboard, door panels, and carpets. Woodgrain trim accents the cabin, and amenities include cruise control, a push-button AM/FM stereo, a CB radio, a power trunk lid release, and power windows and locks. The seller reports that the air conditioning compressor clutch bearing was recently replaced and notes that the system needs to be recharged.",
      "The three-spoke steering wheel fronts a horizontal-sweep 100-mph speedometer and a fuel level gauge. The five-digit odometer shows 28k miles.",
      "The 500ci V8 features a Rochester Quadrajet four-barrel carburetor and was factory rated at 190 horsepower and 360 lb-ft of torque. The seller states that the carburetor was rebuilt, a tune-up was performed, and the oil was changed at approximately 27k miles.",
      "Power is sent to the front wheels through a Turbo Hydra-Matic three-speed automatic transmission."

      "This 2012 Porsche 911 Carrera GTS coupe is a Carrara White-finished example that has been modified with an Aerokit front bumper cover, GT3 RS-style side skirts, 19″ center-lock wheels, a European-style rear bumper cover, a GT3 steering wheel, carbon-fiber sport front bucket seats, RS-style door pulls, red seatbelts, a short shifter, and a Shark Werks exhaust system. Powered by a 3.8-liter flat-six paired with a six-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential, the car is further equipped with a sports suspension, the Sport Chrono Package Plus, a sunroof, black leather upholstery, bi-xenon headlights with PDLS, rear parking sensors, a Bose sound system, and automatic climate control. The current owner acquired the car in 2022 and has since added approximately 2k of the 56k miles. The rear tires were replaced in preparation for the sale. This 997.2 Carrera GTS coupe is now offered in Arizona on dealer consignment with service records, a car cover, spare parts, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Montana title.",
      "The 997 GTS featured a revised front apron with larger air intakes, wider bodywork shared with the contemporary Carrera 4S, and a black front lip spoiler, side skirts, and rear diffuser. This example is finished in Carrara White with an Aerokit front bumper cover, a European-style rear bumper cover, GT3 RS-style side skirts, bi-xenon headlights with PDLS, rear parking sensors, a sunroof, a speed-activated rear spoiler, LED taillights, and quad exhaust outlets.",
      "Black-finished 19″ center-lock wheels were reportedly sourced from a GT3 RS and are mounted with 245/35 front and 315/30 rear Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires, the rear of which were installed in July 2024. Braking is handled by red Porsche-branded calipers over cross-drilled and ventilated rotors. The car is equipped with Porsche Stability Management (PSM), an automatic brake differential (ABD), and was optioned with Porsche Active Suspension Management Sport suspension, which lowered the ride height by 20mm when compared with the standard Carrera.",
      "The carbon-fiber sport front bucket seats are trimmed in black leather with red seatbelts, Porsche crests on the headrests, and color-contrasting stitching, while carbon-fiber trim accents the cabin. Porsche-branded floor mats line the footwells, and additional appointments include a Bose sound system, cruise control, PCM with navigation, RS-style door pulls, a short shifter, and automatic climate control. The driver-side door latch assembly was replaced and the passenger-side airbag off warning light were replaced in 2017. A carbon-fiber trim on the right side of the dashboard has deformed.",
      "The GT3-sourced steering wheel frames a central tachometer with a 7,400-rpm redline as well as a 200-mph speedometer and gauges for oil temperature, coolant temperature, oil pressure, and fuel level. The optional Sport Chrono Package added a stopwatch atop the dashboard. The digital odometer indicates 56k miles, approximately 2k of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The 3.8-liter flat-six was factory rated at 408 horsepower and 310 lb-ft of torque in the GTS, an increase of 23 horsepower over the contemporary Carrera S. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a six-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. The car has been fitted with a Shark Werks exhaust system, and the seller states that the catalytic converters have been retained. A compression and leak-down test was performed in September 2017 by Auto Tronics in Southampton, Pennsylvania, and the results are viewable in the image gallery below. The clutch assembly was also replaced at this time. Replacement spark plugs were reportedly installed at approximately 50k miles, and an oil change was performed in October 2023.",
      "The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage.",
      "There is currently a lien out on the car, and the owner’s lender will need to be paid off before the title can be transferred to the new owner."

      "This 2006 Porsche Cayenne Turbo is a black-over-black example powered by a twin-turbocharged 4.5-liter V8 paired with a six-speed Tiptronic S automatic transmission. Equipment includes cat-less downpipes, a panoramic sunroof, four-zone automatic climate control, ParkAssist, 20″ Cayenne Sport Techno wheels, heated power-adjustable front seats, a Bose sound system, Porsche Entry and Drive, and an aftermarket touchscreen stereo. The vehicle spent time in New York, Pennsylvania, and Missouri before the selling dealer’s recent acquisition, and it now has under 108k miles. This Cayenne Turbo is now offered by the selling dealer at no reserve with service records and a clean Missouri title.",
      "The vehicle is finished in black with black trim and features a panoramic sunroof, bi-xenon headlights, fog lights, front and rear parking sensors, a rear window wiper, and sport tailpipes. The Carfax report notes that the rear of the vehicle sustained “minor damage” in an August 2016 accident, and the selling dealer notes evidence of paintwork on a rear quarter panel. Noted blemishes include stone chips on the front bumper cover and dings and scratches around the body.",
      "The 20″ Cayenne Sport Techno alloy wheels are mounted with Cooper tires. The vehicle is equipped with an air suspension and Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM). Stopping power is from red Porsche-branded calipers over ventilated rotors at each corner. The front lower control arms were replaced in January 2021.",
      "The heated power-adjustable front seats have debossed Porsche crests in the headrests and are upholstered in black leather. Other interior features include four-zone automatic climate control, a Bose sound system, cruise control, Porsche Entry and Drive, illuminated Turbo-branded door sill guards, a carbon-fiber shift handle, and an aftermarket touchscreen stereo. The rearview camera is not connected to the navigation screen and the selling dealer notes wear on interior surfaces.",
      "The carbon-fiber- and leather-rimmed multi-function steering wheel features shifter switches and frames a 180-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 6,400-rpm redline as well as gauges for oil temperature, coolant temperature, fuel level, and boost pressure. The digital odometer indicates under 108k miles.",
      "The twin-turbocharged 4.5-liter V8 was factory rated at 450 horsepower and 457 lb-ft of torque. The selling dealer states that cat-less downpipes are installed. Records indicate that the driveshaft flex disc, valve cover gaskets, and camshaft plugs and seals were replaced in January 2021, and the starter was replaced in September 2021.",
      "Power is routed to all four wheels through a six-speed Tiptronic S automatic transmission, a dual-range transfer case, and a variable center differential.",
      "The Carfax report notes the aforementioned accident entry and at least one recall."

The car features a modified exhaust system, 16″ flat disc wheels, and adjustable coilovers with Boge dampers in addition to power-adjustable front seats, a sunroof, a 930S-style steering wheel, automatic climate control, and a Bluetooth-capable Blaupunkt stereo. Steinels Autowerks of Twinsburg, Ohio, serviced its 5.0-liter DOHC V8, five-speed manual transaxle, brakes, and climate-control system in preparation for the sale to its current owner on BaT in January 2023, and the tires have since been replaced. This 928S is offered on dealer consignment with a clean Carfax report and a clean Montana title in the owner’s name.",
      "The Pastel Beige finish was covered with paint protection film under previous ownership. Equipment includes pop-up headlights, headlamp washers, integrated fog lights, body-color mirror caps, a sunroof, a rear spoiler, a rear wiper, and dual exhaust outlets.",
      "Anodized 16″ flat disc wheels are mounted with Pirelli P Zero Rosso tires. The suspension has Boge and 928 Motorsport components as well as aftermarket drop links and end links.",
      "The power-adjustable front seats are upholstered in brown leather, and sisal mats line the footwells. Interior appointments include automatic climate control, rear air conditioning, cruise control, a Blaupunkt Bremen SQR 46 DAB stereo, a Hi-Fi sound system, power windows, and a short-shift kit.",
      "The 930S-style steering wheel sits on a raised hub and frames VDO instrumentation. The six-digit odometer shows 68k miles, approximately 400 of which were added under current ownership. The heater control valve was replaced in January 2023. The removed steering wheel is included in the sale.",
      "Factory rated at 288 horsepower and 302 lb-ft of torque, the 5.0-liter DOHC V8 features LH-Jetronic fuel injection and a factory-uprated cooling system, and it sends power to the rear wheels through a five-speed manual transaxle. The fuel pressure damper and air mass sensor o-ring were replaced in January 2023 along with the oxygen sensor and its wiring harness, at which time the clutch slave cylinder and hydraulic fluids were also replaced. Seepage is noted from the valve cover gaskets.",
      "The exhaust system has an aftermarket X-pipe and a bypassed rear muffler.",
      "The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage."

The car was assembled in the 1990s, refreshed in 2009, and acquired by the selling dealer in 2024. This 550 Spyder replica is now offered with service records and a clean Ohio title listing it as a 1955 Porsche.",
      "The fiberglass bodywork is mounted to a tubular steel frame and is finished in silver. Exterior details include a driver’s helmet fairing, gold-finished Porsche and Spyder badging, a GT-style mirror, mesh headlight grilles, Wendler fender badges, a Le Mans-style fuel filler, and a dual-grille engine cover with leather hold-down straps. Images detailing the condition of the exterior are presented in the gallery below.",

      "The fixed-back bucket seats are trimmed red upholstery and are joined by color-coordinated carpeting and door panel inserts. Interior elements include a height-adjustable rearview mirror, a passenger grab handle, a Jamar Performance shifter, and a 550-style parking brake. A knob for the engine bay Halon fire-suppression system is mounted on the left side of the dashboard.",
      "The wood-rimmed three-spoke steering wheel wears a Porsche crest horn button and frames a central tachometer flanked by a 200-km/h speedometer and a combination gauge, while readouts for boost pressure, oil pressure, oil temperature, and cylinder head temperature are mounted in a stack ahead of the shifter. The five-digit mechanical odometer shows 22k kilometers (~14k miles).",
      "The air-cooled 2,276cc flat-four was reportedly assembled by Competition Engineering of Phoenix, Arizona, and installed circa 2009. The engine utilizes an AutoLinea aluminum case and has been fitted with a Garrett turbocharger, an XS Power intercooler, a Turbosmart wastegate and dual-stage boost controller, a Snow Performance methanol injection kit, an external oil cooler, an extended capacity oil sump, dual Dell’Orto DRLA carburetors, and MSD ignition with boost retard. Service in June 2024 included changing the oil, adjusting the valves, cleaning the fuel filter and carburetors, and replacing the pushrod tubes and seals, fuel hoses, valve cover gaskets, spark plugs, and the distributor cap and rotor.",
      "Power is delivered to the rear wheels through a four-speed manual transaxle with a Quaife limited-slip differential and a hydraulically-actuated clutch slave cylinder. Urethane transaxle mounts were installed in June 2024.",

      "This 1955 Chevrolet 210 two-door Handyman wagon was initially delivered to Washburn Chevrolet of Santa Barbara, California, and was built as a tribute to the current owner’s father, the former proprietor of the aforementioned dealership, which campaigned Corvette race cars driven by Bob Bondurant in the 1960s. Known as the Grey Snapper, the car was refinished in metallic gray during the build and the cabin was trimmed in tan and saddle leather and fitted with BMW-sourced front seats, a custom center console, a Hurst shifter, and AutoMeter instrumentation. Power is provided by a 5.7-liter LS6 V8 linked with a six-speed manual transmission, and further details include electric exhaust cut-outs, an aluminum radiator, rear air springs, four-wheel disc brakes, and 16″ Halibrand magnesium wheels. This modified Handyman wagon is offered on dealer consignment in Oregon with a Washington state title in the current owner’s name.",
      "The exterior was repainted by Corby Auto Body of Santa Rosa, California, reportedly in the BMW shade of Sterling Grey, and the frame was powder-coated during the build. Details include a hood ornament, a horizontal-slat grille, hooded headlights, and chrome bumpers and bodyside trim.",
      "Halibrand 16″ magnesium wheels wheels are mounted with 245/50 BFGoodrich g-Force Comp-2 tires that were installed in preparation for the sale. Air springs are fitted on the independent rear suspension, and braking is provided by four-wheel discs.",
      "The power-operated front bucket seats are said to have been sourced from a BMW sedan, and the seating surfaces were reupholstered in saddle, tan, and brown leather by BK Upholstery of Cotati, California. Further details include bowtie dashboard trim, a Hurst shifter, an AM radio, a heater and defroster, and a center console with cupholders. The cargo area was upholstered to match the cabin.",
      "The wood-rimmed steering wheel sits on a chrome tilting column ahead of AutoMeter instrumentation including 120-mph speedometer, a tachometer, and readouts for oil pressure, fuel level, and water temperature. The five-digit odometer shows 227 miles, and the total mileage is unknown.",
      "The 5.7-liter LS6 V8 was installed in 2010 and is equipped with a conical air filter, an aluminum radiator, and red fuel rail covers along with electric exhaust cut-outs. Fluid services were performed in preparation for the sale. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential.",
      "The current Washington state title is a duplicate and bears a Classic brand."

      "This 1964 Porsche 356C is a Karmann-built coupe that was built on October 9, 1963 and originally delivered to California. It was refurbished at Gallery Aaldering in the Netherlands and imported to the US after the current owner’s acquisition in 2023. The car is finished in silver over red leatherette and is powered by a 1.6-liter flat-four and four-speed manual transaxle. Equipment includes a Blaupunkt multi-band radio, a Brantz digital tripmeter, VDO instrumentation, 15” wheels, and four-wheel disc brakes. The dual Dellorto carburetors were rebuilt within the last year, and the steering coupler, wheel bearing seals, shocks, and ignition components were replaced. This 356C is now offered on dealer consignment in Arizona with a copy of the Kardex, a tool roll, and a clean Florida title listing it as a 1963 model.",
      "Finished from the factory in Slate Gray, the car was repainted silver during the aforementioned refurbishment. Exterior details include a windshield washer system, a twin-grille decklid, and dual exhaust outlets that exit through the rear overriders.",
      "Silver-finished 15” steel wheels wear polished Porsche-crest hubcaps and are mounted with 165-series Vredestein Sprint Classic tires. Work performed in 2024 included replacing the steering coupler, wheel bearing seals, and Sachs shocks. Braking is handled by four-wheel discs.",
      "The cabin has been retrimmed in red leatherette that extends to the seats, door panels, dashboard pad, and rear bulkhead. Black squareweave carpets line the floors, and a Blaupunkt multi-band radio is accompanied by an analog clock. Discoloration on the left rear jump seat upholstery can be viewed in the gallery along with pitting on the interior brightwork. A Brantz International 2 Pro digital tripmeter has been installed below the dash.",
      "The three-spoke steering wheel fronts VDO green-letter instrumentation consisting of a central 6k-rpm tachometer flanked by a 200-km/h speedometer and a combination gauge for oil temperature and fuel level. The five-digit odometer shows 434 kilometers (~270 miles), and total mileage is unknown.",
      "The air-cooled 1.6L flat-four is equipped with dual Dellorto carburetors that were rebuilt in 2024. The distributor cap, ignition coil, and battery were also replaced. Compression test results are presented in the gallery.",
      "The engine number P☆711022☆ is shown above, and a corresponding number is listed on the Kardex.",

      "This 2005 Porsche 911 Carrera S coupe was initially registered in California where it spent much of its time prior to an East coast relocation, and it has 104k miles. It is finished in Black over black standard leather and is powered by a 3.8-liter flat-six paired with a six-speed manual transaxle. Equipment includes the Sport Chrono Package Plus, 19″ aftermarket wheels, a deployable rear spoiler, bi-xenon headlights, a sunroof, heated power-adjustable front seats, automatic climate control, cruise control, a Bose sound system, and Porsche Communication Management (PCM) with navigation. This 997.1 C2S coupe is now offered in Florida by the selling dealer at no reserve with the owner’s manual, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Delaware title.",
      "The car is finished in Black (041) and features a power sunroof, a speed-activated rear spoiler, a rear window wiper, bi-xenon headlights, fog lights, rain-sensing windshield wipers, quad exhaust outlets. Windshield cowl trim was replaced in August 2021  Photos depicting paint-meter readings are provided in the gallery. There is a scuff in the front bumper cover at the mounting point of the license plate holder.",
      "The 19″ aftermarket wheels are wrapped in Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires measuring 235/35 up front and 295/30 out back. Braking is handled by multi-piston Porsche-branded brake calipers fitted over cross-drilled and vented rotors at all four corners. The car is equipped with Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM) as well as Porsche Stability Management (PSM), an active brake differential (ABD), and Anti-Slip Regulation (ASR). The front struts were replaced in October 2021.",
      "The cabin features heated power-adjustable front seats trimmed in black Standard leather. Features include driver’s seat memory settings, a Bose sound system, a CD stereo with a remote disc changer, automatic climate control, cruise control, and Porsche Communication Management with navigation. A satellite radio receiver is installed at the bottom of the center stack.",
      "The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a central tachometer and a 200-mph speedometer as well as gauges for oil temperature, oil pressure, coolant temperature, and fuel level. The optional Sport Chrono Package Plus added a stopwatch atop the dashboard. The digital odometer indicates 104k miles.",
      "The 3.8-liter M97 flat-six features dry-sump lubrication and was factory rated at 355 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. The battery was replaced in May 2024.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed manual transaxle. The clutch and the flywheel were replaced in October 2021.",
      "Decoding the option sticker reveals the following information:",
      "The Carfax report is free of accidents or other damage."

The body was disassembled and refinished in black during the build, and exterior details include a front and rear spoiler, a custom front grille, a vented cowl induction hood, black bumpers, and Ringbrothers mirrors and door handles. The car rides on a coilover suspension and a Speedtech torque arm kit as well as staggered-diameter U.S. Mags wheels mounted over Wilwood disc brakes. The cabin was fitted with TMI Products bucket seats trimmed in red leather and microsuede as well as a Vintage Air climate control unit, a Lokar shifter, a Holley digital instrument cluster, a full-length center console, and a digital media player connected to Focal audio components. This modified Camaro coupe is offered in Canada with build records and Alberta registration.",
      "The body was disassembled before being fitted with replacement quarter panels and repainted in black during the build, and a custom front grille, headlight trim, and hood vents were fitted as well as replacement glass and LED lighting. Additional details include smoothed body-color bumpers, front and rear spoilers, driving lights, a Detroit Speed wiper mechanism, tinted side marker and taillight lenses, and Ringbrothers door handles and mirrors.",
      "The car rides on Speedtech adjustable coilovers and tubular control arms as well as a four-link rear setup, and a Sweet Manufacturing steering rack was installed during the build.

A Detroit Speed mini-tub kit was fitted to accommodate the wider rear tires. Braking is handled by black Wilwood calipers over slotted and drilled rotors, and an electric emergency brake system is installed.",
      "The cabin was fitted with TMI Products front and rear bucket seats trimmed in red leather and microsuede and black grommets, and matching upholstery adorns the trunk, center consoles, doors, and Nova-style dashboard. Appointments include Vintage Air climate control, a rearview camera, a Lokar shifter and hood release, power windows, billet door handles, and a Velex digital media center linked with Focal speakers and amplifiers.",
      "The TMI Products steering wheel frames a configurable Holley digital instrument cluster. The odometer shows 474 miles, which is said to represent the mileage added since the completion of the build. Total mileage is unknown.",
      "The supercharged 6.2-liter LSA crate V8 was installed during the build and is equipped with a black anodized billet accessory drive system, an adjustable fuel pressure regulator, custom engine covers, and a Holley wiring harness. The hood opens on billet hinges to reveal a smoothed firewall and an oversized radiator support trim and inner fenders.",

A Speedtech torque arm kit is installed along with a Rick’s fuel tank, a ZL1-specification fuel pump, and Detroit Speed subframe connectors. Stainless-steel headers flow to powder-coated and thermally wrapped 3″ piping, an X-pipe midsection, and chambered mufflers.",

Finished in Granada Red, the bike received a replacement clutch, valves, valve covers, and pushrods and tubes as well as ignition components, front fender, fork ears, and more as detailed below. The bike is also equipped with 18″ alloy rims, a driveshaft, dual Bing carburetors, a black Pagusa saddle, a chrome handlebar, bar-end turn signals, headlight-mounted mirrors, and both center and side stands. The selling dealer acquired the bike in 2023, and work in December of that year included changing the fluids, lubricating the driveshaft, and replacing the tires. This R69US is now offered at no reserve in New York with a tool kit, a removed fork, service records, and a clean Illinois title.",
      "The bike is finished in Granada Red with white pinstripes, and a pair of Oldtimers Enduro saddlebags were fitted after being painted to match. The Pagusa solo seat received a replacement frame, and the headlight ears, front fender, fork lock, and fuel cap were replaced. Additional bike features include headlight-mounted mirrors, black rubber tank grips, a frame-mounted air pump, an LED taillight, a center stand, and a replacement side stand.",
      "Wire-spoke wheels with 18″ alloy rims and drum-brake hubs were mounted with Heidenau tires in December 2023. Suspension is provided by an Earles fork as well as a pair of shocks mounted to the swingarm on the left and the final-drive housing on the right. The front end was straightened during the 2015 refurbishment, and the wheel bearings and rear brake shoes were replaced.",
      "The chrome handlebar carries bar-end turn signals and Magura grips, and it is secured aft of a chrome adjuster for the steering damper. Instrumentation ahead consists of a VDO 120-mph speedometer and a trio of indicator lights. The five-digit odometer shows 47k miles, approximately 30 of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The 594cc opposed twin features a kick starter, dual Bing carburetors, and a chrome dual exhaust system. A rebuild in 2015 was carried out with a rebuilt crankshaft, over-bored cylinders, and 73.5mm pistons, with a resultant displacement of 619cc. The cylinder heads were also rebuilt, the oil slingers were cleaned, and a 12-volt alternator was fitted. The following components were replaced during the rebuild:",
      "Work in December 2023 consisted of clearing the carburetor jets, lubricating the driveshaft, and changing the oils in the engine, gearbox, and final-drive housing.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheel through a four-speed transmission as well as a driveshaft enclosed within the right leg of the swingarm. The gearbox and final-drive assembly were rebuilt in 2015 with replacement bearings and seals, and the clutch was replaced at that time.",

The car is said to have been sold new in Florida before being brought to Canada in the 1970s and underwent a body-off refurbishment in 1988 that involved a repaint in Silver Blue. It features flip-up headlamps and quad tail lamps along with reproduction 15″ turbine-style knock-off wheels. Inside, the bucket seats are trimmed in black vinyl and accompanied by a Delco AM/FM radio, an analog clock, and a split-spoke steering wheel. Acquired by the current owner and returned to the US in 2014, this C2 split-window coupe is now offered in Round Rock, Texas, on dealer consignment with NCRS judging forms, partial service records, and a clean Texas title.",
      "The fiberglass body left the factory finished in Silver Blue (912) and was removed from the frame and repainted as part of the aforementioned refurbishment completed in 1988. The fiberglass underbody panels were also refinished at that time. The car features flip-up headlamps, quad tail lamps, fender vents, chrome bumperettes, and dual exhaust tips that exit through the rear valance. The selling dealer notes that the paint was polished in 2023 and reports a chip on the right-rear quarter panel as well as blemishes on the left-front fender.",
      "The reproduction 15″ turbine-style wheels were produced by Western Wheel Corporation and wear three-eared knock-off spinners. Maxxis MA-1 M+S tires measuring 215/70 are mounted at all four corners . The C2 was the first Corvette to offer fully independent suspension, with upper and lower control arms at the front and a three-link setup with a transverse leaf spring at the rear. Braking is handled by four-wheel drums, which were serviced in March 2023.",
      "The cabin features two bucket seats upholstered in black vinyl as well as color-coordinated door panels and carpets. Amenities include a Delco AM/FM radio, an analog clock, a heater, and lap belts.",
      "The split-spoke steering wheel frames a 160-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 6,500-rpm redline as well as gauges for amperage, oil pressure, coolant temperature, and fuel level. The five-digit odometer shows 75k miles, approximately 2k of which have been added under current ownership.",
      "The 327ci L76 V8 was fitted from the factory with a single Carter four-barrel carburetor and a high-lift camshaft for a factory rating of 340 horsepower.",
      "The engine stamping includes sequence 3120127, which matches the last six digits of the vehicle’s serial number. The RE suffix corresponds with a 340-horsepower, 327ci V8 for use with a manual transmission.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a Muncie M20 four-speed close-ratio manual transmission and an optional Positraction differential. The frame is said to have been sandblasted and repainted black as part of the 1988 refurbishment, and the underside of the car was cleaned in 2024 in preparation for the sale.",

      "This 1989 Dodge Dakota is one of approximately 1,500 built with Shelby modifications including a 5.2-liter V8, alloy wheels, and special interior and exterior trim. Finished in white over a burgundy and grey cloth interior, it also has a limited-slip differential, a sliding rear window, air conditioning, and a cassette stereo. The truck was acquired new by the seller, and it shows 12k miles. This Shelby Dakota is offered with a window sticker, manufacturer’s literature, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Wisconsin title in the name of the seller’s trust.",
      "The Shelby Dakota was offered for the 1989 model year only at a $4k premium over the base truck, and approximately 640 examples were finished in Bright White. Exterior revisions included a lower front air dam with fog lights, black bumpers and fender flares, a windshield visor, and a buttressed hoop over the bed, which has a ribbed plastic liner. The rear bumper has been refinished.",
      "Hollow-spoke 15″ alloy wheels are mounted with 225/70 Goodyear Eagle GT+4 tires. Anti-lock braking was standard, with discs up front and drums at the rear.",
      "The bench seat is trimmed in burgundy vinyl and velour with Shelby-pattern grey cloth inserts, and the cab has air conditioning, a cassette stereo, and a sliding rear window. The headliner is loose.",
      "A racing-style steering wheel with a “CS” horn button frames a tachometer, a 125-mph speedometer, and a six-digit odometer showing 12k miles. A dashboard-mounted plaque notes the truck as number 983 in its series.",
      "The 5.2-liter V8 was sourced from the contemporary Dodge Ram and fitted with an electric fan in order to provide clearance in the engine bay. Factory output was quoted at 175 horsepower with 270 lb-ft of torque when new. A Shelby Automobiles plate with an engine number is mounted on the top of the radiator support.",
      "The four-speed New Process automatic transmission features an overdrive gear, an auxiliary oil cooler, and a high-stall torque converter. It sends power to the rear wheels through a limited-slip differential with 3.90:1 gearing.",
      "The window sticker lists factory colors, equipment, and a total price of $16,670.",
      "The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage."

Work performed in 2023 involved cleaning and adjusting the carburetors, changing the oil, and replacing the fuel pump and ignition components. Acquired by the selling dealer in 2024, this 240Z is now offered with partial service records, refurbishment documents, and a clean South Carolina title.",
      "Finished from the factory in Blue Metallic (115), the car was repainted and the weatherstripping and window seals were replaced as part of the aforementioned refurbishment in 2018. Details include General Electric headlights, a left-side mirror, Z badging on the C-pillars, bright window trim, and a retractable antenna.",

The car was factory equipped with an independent suspension, a front stabilizer bar, and rack-and-pinion steering. Stopping is provided by power-assisted front disc and rear drum brakes.",
      "The bucket seats were reupholstered in white vinyl in January 2019, at which time the trim, dome light, carpets, seatbelts, door pulls, and shifter and emergency brake boots were also replaced. A Kenwood CD stereo and speakers have been fitted, and additional appointments include sound-deadening insulation,  a center console, a lockable glove compartment, an electric rear window defogger, and a heater.",
      "The wood-rimmed steering wheel frames a 160-mph speedometer and tachometer with a 7k-rpm redline. An analog clock and gauges for coolant temperature, oil pressure, amperage, and fuel level are housed over the center stack. The five-digit odometer shows 65k miles, approximately 100 of which have been added under current ownership. Total mileage is unknown.",
      "The 2.4-liter inline-six was factory equipped with dual side-draft carburetors and was rated at 151 horsepower and 146 lb-ft of torque. Work performed in November 2023 involved cleaning and adjusting the carburetors as well as changing the oil and replacing the spark plugs and wires, distributor cap and rotor, and fuel pump and filter.",
      "Power is routed to the rear wheels through a four-speed manual transmission. Spray-on bedliner material was applied to the underside in March 2018.",

      "This 2019 Ford Mustang Shelby GT-S coupe is one of a limited number of units modified by Shelby American in Nevada for sale to Pullach, Germany-based rental car company Sixt, and this example served as a rental car in Florida for approximately one year. The car later spent time in Illinois and Washington before the seller’s December 2023 acquisition, and it now indicates 14k miles. Finished in black with orange stripes over black and orange leather, the car is powered by a supercharged 5.0-liter Coyote V8 mated to a ten-speed automatic transmission. Equipment includes the GT Performance Package, revised engine management software, MagneRide suspension dampers, Brembo front brake calipers, staggered-width 20″ Shelby wheels, dual-zone automatic climate control, adaptive cruise control, heated and ventilated front bucket seats, SYNC 3 infotainment with navigation, and a Bang & Olufsen stereo in addition to an aftermarket supercharger pulley, drive belt, thermostat, fuel pump, fuel injectors, and spark plugs. This Shelby GT-S is offered with spare and removed parts, an accident-free Carfax report, and a clean Washington title in the seller’s name.",
      "The car is finished in black with orange stripes, Sixt Supercharged front fender badges, and body-side Shelby GT-S-branded graphics. Exterior details include a decklid spoiler, a front splitter, aerodynamic side skirts, and quad exhaust outlets with polished finishers. Noted blemishes include swirls in the finish along with scratches on the driver-door window.",
      "Staggered-width 20″ Shelby wheels are finished in black and mounted with 275/35 and 305/30 Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires. The fully independent suspension is equipped with MagneRide adaptive dampers. Stopping power is provided by four-wheel disc brakes, which feature red-finished Brembo calipers at the front corners.",
      "The seating surfaces are trimmed in black leather with orange accents, and embroidered Shelby script accents the backrests of the heated, ventilated, and power-adjustable front bucket seats. Further appointments include dual-zone automatic climate control, adaptive cruise control, a 12-speaker Bang & Olufsen stereo, and a SYNC 3 infotainment system with navigation, Android Auto, and Apple CarPlay.",
      "A plaque affixed to the dashboard identifies this GT-S as #7 produced for the model year.",
      "The leather-wrapped steering wheel fronts a configurable digital instrument cluster with a 160-mph speedometer, a tachometer, and readouts for coolant temperature and fuel level. Additional analog gauges measuring oil pressure and boost pressure are mounted in the center of the dashboard. The digital odometer indicates 14k miles, approximately 1,500 of which have been added by the seller.",
      "The 5.0-liter Coyote V8 was fitted with an Eaton TVS R2650 supercharger as part of the Shelby GT-S package, and it drives the rear wheels through a 10-speed automatic transmission and a 3.55:1 limited-slip differential. Further modifications reportedly include an aftermarket supercharger pulley, drive belt, thermostat, fuel pump, fuel injectors, and spark plugs as well as dynamometer-tuned engine management software. The seller states that the oil and the battery were changed in December 2023.",
      "Additional underside photos are provided in the gallery below.",
      "The Carfax report shows no accidents or other damage, displays rental history from May 2019 to August 2020, and lists history in California, Florida, Illinois, and Washington."

      "This 1970 Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser wagon underwent a refurbishment in 2015 and was acquired by the selling dealer in 2023. It is powered by a 455ci Rocket V8 linked to a three-speed automatic transmission, and it is finished in green over gray and black vinyl upholstery. Features include Aldan American coilovers, Hedman headers, roof rails, tinted windows, a dual-action tailgate, Super Stock II wheels, third-row seats, power-adjustable front bucket seats, an aftermarket stereo, and air conditioning. This Vista Cruiser is now offered by the selling dealer with an owner’s manual, a spare dashboard and air cleaner, and a clean Arizona title in the selling dealer’s name.",
      "The car was finished from the factory in Sherwood Green (48) and was resprayed during the previously noted refurbishment. Exterior equipment includes quad headlights, chrome bumpers, dual side mirrors, white accent stripes, tinted windows, roof rails, “Vista-Roof” raised skylights over the second row of seating and cargo area, and a dual-action tailgate with a power-operated window. Rust repair was performed under current ownership and the paint in those areas was resprayed and blended. Bubbling paint is seen behind the left-rear tire and the roof panels are delaminating.",
      "The 15″ Super Stock II wheels are mounted with Hankook Kinergy ST tires. Aldan American adjustable coilovers have been fitted along with stainless-steel brake lines. The car is also equipped with power steering, and stopping power is provided by power-assisted front disc and rear drum brakes.",
      "The seating surfaces are upholstered in vinyl, and the power-adjustable front bucket seats are said to have been sourced from a later-model Chrysler product. Interior appointments include third-row seats, an aftermarket Kenwood stereo, aftermarket speakers, power windows, and air conditioning. Interior components that were originally green have been dyed black. The left-turn signal and the high beams are not functioning, cracks are seen in the driver door panel and dashboard, and the driver sun visor upholstery is separating.",
      "The steering wheel wears an aftermarket wrap and fronts a 120-mph speedometer, an analog clock, and a fuel-level gauge. Auxiliary gauges have been mounted to the center dash. The five-digit odometer shows 45k miles, approximately 1,500 of which were added under current ownership. The fuel-level gauge does not work.",
      "The car is powered by a 455ci Rocket V8, which the seller notes was refreshed during the 2015 refurbishment. Modifications include an aftermarket chrome air cleaner and Hedman tubular headers.",
      "Power is routed to the rear wheels through a three-speed Turbo-Hydramatic automatic transmission. Holes in the rear floor pan are shown up close in photos below.",
      "Decoding the data plate reveals the following production information:",
      "The Arizona title carries an “Exceeds Mechanical Limits” odometer notation."

Interior amenities include an Airscarf neck-warming system, a Harman Kardon sound system, a six-disc CD changer, an in-dash single-CD player, stainless-steel door sill trim, aluminum pedals, dual-zone automatic climate control, and COMAND infotainment.",
      "The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a 200-mph speedometer and an AMG-branded tachometer with a 6,500-rpm redline alongside an analog clock and a fuel-level gauge. The digital odometer indicates 14k miles.",

      "This 1967 Chevrolet Camaro RS/SS coupe was acquired by the selling dealer in 2023 and subsequently underwent rebuilds of the engine and transmission as well as the addition of a custom dual exhaust system with 3″ stainless-steel piping. The 396ci L35 V8 was overbored and fitted with a Holley 700-CFM carburetor and roller rockers. Shifting is through a three-speed TH400 automatic transmission linked with a Positraction differential. The car is finished in Butternut Yellow and features an SS-style hood, concealed headlights, bumper guards, and front and rear spoilers. Inside, the front bucket seats and folding rear bench are trimmed in black vinyl and accompanied by a Bluetooth-capable stereo and a center console with auxiliary gauges. Further equipment includes power steering, power-assisted front disc brakes, and 14″ Rally wheels. Previously listed on BaT in July 2024, this Camaro coupe is now offered at no reserve by the selling dealer in Lindon, Utah, with a Washington State title.",
      "The body is finished in Butternut Yellow with a black nose stripe, tail panel, and pinstripes. Further details include an SS-style hood with raised simulated air intakes as well as concealed headlights, bumper guards, and front and rear spoilers. A replacement windshield was installed, a black vinyl roof was added, and rocker panels were rechromed under current ownership.",
      "The 14″ Rally wheels are mounted with 205/70 BFGoodrich Silvertown redline tires. The car is equipped with power steering, and braking is handled by power-assisted front discs and rear drums.",
      "The front bucket seats and fold-down rear bench are upholstered in black vinyl, and the car is equipped with lap belts for four passengers. A Bluetooth-capable digital media receiver and aftermarket speakers have been added along with replacement door panels.",
      "The three-spoke steering wheel features an SS-branded horn button and frames a 120-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 5,500-rpm redline. An inoperative clock and two combination gauges are installed within the center console. The five-digit odometer shows 31k miles, approximately 100 of which have been added under current ownership. Total mileage is unknown.",
      "The 396ci L35 V8 was bored 0.030″ over as part of a rebuild completed by South Valley Machine of Sandy, Utah, and was subsequently installed by Gordon Automotive of Orem, Utah, according to the selling dealer. The engine is fitted with a Holley 700-CFM four-barrel carburetor along with roller rockers. A replacement wiring harness has also been added.",
      "The engine block stamping is shown above. Additional casting and stamping numbers from around the vehicle are shown in the gallery below.",

The exhaust system is comprised of factory exhaust manifolds flowing into 3″ stainless-steel piping with Magnaflow mufflers.",
      "The chassis number is consistent with a 1967 Chevrolet Camaro coupe built at the Van Nuys, California, assembly facility with a V8 engine. Decoding the Fisher body tag reveals:",

    "description": [
      "This 1955 BMW R25/3 is said to have been imported to the US during the 1970s and it was acquired by the seller in 1998. Refurbishment work performed at Boxerworks of Watkinsville, Georgia, in November 2022 included replacement of the wiring harness, speedometer, horn, throttle assembly, grips, hand levers, and foot peg rubbers, prior to which the exhaust assembly, center stand, luggage rack, tool box lock, and air tube boot were replaced by the seller. The bike is finished in black and is powered by a 247cc OHV four-stroke single paired with a four-speed transmission. Additional equipment includes an exposed driveshaft, a Denfeld saddle, a hinged rear fender, a Bing carburetor, a leading-axle fork, plunger shocks, a steering damper, alloy rims, and drum brakes. This R25/3 is now offered at no reserve with reprints of owner’s and service manuals, a pillion cushion, service records, historical ownership records, and Georgia registration in the seller’s name.",
      "The bike is finished in black and is presumed to have been repainted under previous ownership. Features include a three-gallon fuel tank with an integrated locking storage compartment and black rubber knee grips as well as a black rubber Denfeld solo saddle suspended on a chrome horizontal spring. Additional equipment includes valanced fenders, a luggage rack, and a center stand. A leak in the fuel tank was repaired under current ownership, the fuel tank was sealed under previous ownership, and the seller notes the presence of paint bubbles on the front fender.",
      "Wire-spoke wheels with shouldered 18″ alloy rims are mounted with older Continental front and IRC Grand High Speed GS-11 rear tires. Suspension consists of a conventional leading-axle fork with sliders that were cleaned, straightened, polished, and fitted with replacement seals during the refurbishment. A pair of shrouded plunger shocks are fitted at the rear. Braking is handled by 160mm drums at both ends.",
      "A chrome handlebar equipped with a replacement throttle assembly, hand levers, and grips is clamped by rear-offset risers ahead of the key-handle adjustment knob for a friction-plate damper in the steering stem. Instrumentation consisting of a replacement 140-km/h VDO speedometer with shift points indicated in blue is inset atop the headlight bucket. The five-digit odometer shows 15 kilometers. True mileage is unknown.",
      "The 247cc OHV single was factory rated at 13 horsepower and features a 24mm Bing carburetor, a kick starter, and a replacement exhaust system with a polished slip-on torpedo-style muffler. Additional items replaced during the refurbishment included the air tube boot, intake gaskets, wiring harness, and battery.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheel through a single-plate dry clutch, a four-speed transmission, and an exposed driveshaft. The engine, transmission, and final drive oils were changed during the refurbishment.",
      "The number 326313 stamped on the frame matches the numbers stamped on the steering head plate and the engine case, photos of which can be viewed in the gallery.",
      "The bike does not have a title, as it is registered in a state that does not issue titles for vehicles of its age. It is being sold on its Georgia registration document."

    "description": [
      "This 1989 BMW 325i coupe was registered in California and Florida before it was acquired by the current owner in 2023, and it is powered by a 2.5-liter M20 inline-six paired with a five-speed manual transmission. BBS 15″ alloy wheels and Recaro front bucket seats have been installed, and additional modifications are said to include a limited-slip differential with a 2.93: final drive ratio as well as Bilstein dampers, H&R springs, aftermarket rear subframe and engine mounts, polyurethane transmission mounts, and a Condor differential stud kit. Finished in Alpine White, the car is equipped with fog lights, a front spoiler, black kidney grilles, a sunroof, a Pioneer CD stereo, and cruise control. This E30 coupe shows 190k miles and is now offered on dealer consignment with service records, a Carfax report, and a clean Florida title.",
      "The car is finished in Alpine White and features aluminum trim, quad headlights, fog lights, a manually-adjustable sunroof, pop-out rear windows, and a power antenna. A Volvo-sourced front spoiler, black kidney grilles, BMW Motorsport door handles, and window tinting have been added. The Carfax report lists a rear-end collision with another vehicle in September 2018, and the report indicates that the vehicle was not damaged. The selling dealer notes that corrosion on the edges of the sunroof has been treated.",
      "The 15″ BBS lightweight alloy wheels feature 42 Draft Designs spacers and are mounted with a combination of 205/50 Federal, Zeetex, and Dunlop tires. The suspension has been modified with Bilstein dampers and H&R springs. Braided stainless-steel brake lines have been added, and braking is handled by ventilated front and solid rear discs with ABS. The selling dealer states that the wheel bearings were recently replaced, and the brake master cylinder was reportedly replaced in 2023.",
      "Recaro front buckets seats with black cloth upholstery and Recaro-script inserts have been installed, and further interior details include a beige cloth-trimmed rear bench, CD Pioneer stereo, a replacement shift knob, and cruise control. The air conditioning functions intermittently, and there are stains on the rear seat.",
      "A worn three-spoke steering wheel frames a 150-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 6,250-rpm redline as well as gauges for coolant temperature, instant fuel economy, and fuel level. The six-digit odometer shows 190k miles, approximately 600 of which were added under current ownership. There is a crack in the instrument cluster lens, and the Carfax report lists an odometer reading of 192,262 in a March 2024 entry.",
      "The 2.5-liter M20B25 inline-six was factory rated at 168 horsepower and 164 lb-ft of torque. A Mishimoto aluminum radiator, an MSD Blaster SS ignition coil, an oil cooler, and engine mounts have been installed. Photos of service records are viewable in the image gallery below, and the selling dealer states that service in 2023 included replacing the timing belts, water pump, fan clutch, coolant temperature sensor, crankshaft position sensor, battery, fuel filter, belts, ignition wires, coolant hoses, vacuum lines, and exhaust manifold gaskets. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a five-speed manual transmission and a retrofitted limited-slip differential with a 2.93:1 final drive ratio. Rebuilt rear axles have been installed along with AKG rear subframe mounts, a Condor differential stud kit, and Condor polyurethane transmission mounts, according to the selling dealer.",
      "The Carfax report lists the aforementioned accident."

      "This 1972 Chevrolet K5 Blazer underwent a multi-year refurbishment and modification process that was completed in August 2022 before being acquired by the owner on BaT in December 2022. Work included refinishing the body in Torch Red and white, sandblasting and painting the frame, reupholstering the interior, and installing a 5.3-liter Vortec V8 linked with a rebuilt TH350 three-speed automatic transmission and a dual-range transfer case.  Additional equipment includes a removable white single-wall hardtop, 15″ wheels, a suspension lift, a custom exhaust system, Warn locking front hubs, front disc brakes, an aluminum radiator, and a RetroSound stereo with a Kicker amplifier and subwoofer. This K5 Blazer is now offered by the seller on behalf of the owner with a clean Texas title.",
      "The body was stripped and repaired before being repainted in two-tone Torch Red and white under prior ownership. The frame was sandblasted and coated with POR 15, and additional work included applying RAPTOR Coatings to the tub and fender wells as well as replacing the windshield, weatherstripping and seals, and woodgrain side moldings and tailgate trim.",
      "Silver-finished 15″ Rally wheels wear polished trim rings and are mounted with 33×12.5″ BFGoodrich All-Terrain T/A K02 white-letter tires. The suspension is modified with a 2.5″ lift kit as well as aftermarket shocks, and the truck is equipped with a power-assisted Redhead steering box along with Warn locking front hubs. Braking is handled by power-assisted front discs and rear drums.",
      "The bucket seats and rear bench were reupholstered in black vinyl with houndstooth cloth inserts joined by a body-color dashboard. Kilmat sound deadening mat is reportedly installed under replacement black carpeting, and additional equipment includes a heater, a center console, rubber floor mats, a dome light, and an aftermarket RetroSound stereo with Kicker speakers, an amplifier, and a subwoofer.",
      "The four-spoke steering wheel is mounted on a replacement steering column and frames a 100-mph speedometer and supplementary gauges. The five-digit odometer shows 77k miles, of which approximately 60 were added under current ownership. True mileage is unknown.",
      "The 5.3-liter Vortec V8 was installed during the refurbishment using a Dirty Dingo engine crossmember and mounts. Additional equipment includes a replacement wiring harness, a dual exhaust system with exhaust headers, an aluminum radiator with twin electric fans, and a custom air intake system with an open air cone filter.",
      "Power is sent to the rear or all four wheels through a TH350 three-speed automatic transmission and a dual-range transfer case. The transmission is said to have been rebuilt under prior ownership."

      "This 1999 Kawasaki KX500 was reportedly refurbished before it was acquired by the seller in 2023. Powered by a liquid-cooled 499cc two-stroke single, the bike wears green aftermarket bodywork over a green powder-coated frame. It also features a reupholstered seat, a Keihin carburetor, an inverted cartridge-type fork, a Uni-Trak monoshock linkage, front and rear disc brakes, laced wheels with Takasago Excel rims, and custom-fabricated link arms in addition to a FLY Racing handlebar, UFO hand grips, and FMF exhaust components. This KX500 is offered at no reserve in Georgia for off-road use only with spare and removed parts and a bill of sale.",
      "The bike wears green bodywork over a semi-double cradle frame that was reportedly sandblasted and powder-coated in green under previous ownership. Additional refurbishment work is said to have included installing a Clark fuel tank, an Acerbis front mudguard, UFO plastic body panels, a stainless-steel bolt kit, and aftermarket graphics as well as a replacement subframe and blue vinyl seat cover. The bike is not equipped with a deployable side stand.",
      "Laced wheels with gold-finished 21″ front and 18″ rear Takasago Excel alloy rims wear a Kenda tire up front and a Sedona tire out back. Stopping power is provided by front and rear disc brakes with braided stainless-steel lines. Adjustable suspension consists of a 46mm inverted cartridge-type fork with stanchion guards in addition to a monoshock attached to the powder-coated swingarm via a Uni-Trak linkage. The bike has been fitted with custom-fabricated link arms, and the seller states that the fork seals, brake rotors and pads, and swingarm guide and bearings were replaced under previous ownership.",
      "The black-finished FLY Racing handlebar carries a bolt-on cross brace, UFO hand grips, and replacement levers and cables in addition to a replacement ignition cut-off switch and throttle housing. No instrumentation is present, therefore total mileage is unknown. The seller estimates that two hours have been ridden since the refurbishment was completed under previous ownership, approximately one of which was ridden by the seller.",
      "The liquid-cooled 499cc two-stroke single features an FMF Gnarly expansion chamber, an FMF silencer, and GPI Racing radiators and hoses. Work performed as part of the refurbishment is said to have involved rebuilding the Keihin carburetor, installing a water pump shaft seal kit, and replacing the kick starter, air filter, reed valve, and spark plug.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheel through a five-speed transmission and a replacement drive chain, which rolls on replacement sprockets and has been fitted with an Acerbis chain guide and rollers. The seller states that the clutch and the shift lever were replaced under previous ownership.",
      "Various spare and removed parts will accompany the bike.",
      "The bike does not have a title or registration and is being sold on a bill of sale only."

The Autostick shifter allows manual gear selection of the automatic transaxle, and additional equipment includes air conditioning, cruise control, an Infinity sound system, an AM/FM/cassette stereo, and a six-disc CD changer.",
      "The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames an AutoMeter tachometer while a body-color instrument panel in the center of the dashboard houses a 150-mph speedometer and gauges for voltage, oil pressure, coolant temperature, and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 25k miles.",
      "The 3.5-liter V6 features an aluminum block and was factory rated at 253 horsepower and 255 lb-ft of torque. The water pump was replaced in September 2019.",
      "Power is delivered to the rear wheels through a torque tube and a rear-mounted four-speed automatic transaxle. Underglow lights have reportedly been added.",

Additional features include woodgrain dashboard trim, a Hurst T-handle shifter, Vintage Air climate control, power windows, front and rear audio speakers, and a retro-style digital stereo with satellite reception and Bluetooth connectivity.",
      "The Formula-style steering wheel fronts a 160-mph speedometer, a tachometer with a 5k-rpm redline, and auxiliary gauges. The five-digit odometer shows 64k miles, approximately 1k of which were added by the selling dealer. Total mileage is unknown.",

      "This 1972 BMW 2002tii was initially delivered to Helmut’s Small Car Service of Bridgeport, Connecticut, and is said to have been kept in storage between the 1980s and 2008, when a refurbishment was carried out. It was then listed on BaT in November 2021 before subsequently being acquired by the seller. Power comes from a replacement 2.0-liter M10 inline-four mated to a four-speed manual transmission, and the car has been repainted Ceylon Metallic and modified with a PerTronix ignition system, Bilstein shocks, and Ireland Engineering springs and sway bars. Additional equipment includes 13″ steel wheels with chrome-finished covers as well as a cabin heater, a Blaupunkt AM/FM stereo, and front bucket seats that have been reupholstered in black vinyl. The Kugelfischer fuel-injection system was overhauled prior to the seller’s acquisition, and work under current ownership included replacing the fuel tank and engine mounts. This roundie tii is now offered with a window sticker, manufacturer’s literature, service manuals, service records dating to 1972, a car cover, and a clean California title in the seller’s name.",
      "As part of the aforementioned refurbishment, the car was stripped before being repainted in Ceylon Metallic. The bumpers were re-chromed and the bumper impact strips and rocker panel trim pieces were replaced under previous ownership, while the fenders, rocker panels, and various front body panels are said to have been replaced in the 1980s. Additional exterior details include vent windows, dual side mirrors, round taillights, and a chrome exhaust finisher. The trim on the driver’s door is dented.",
      "Silver-finished 13″ steel wheels with chrome-finished covers are mounted with 185/70 Kumho Solus TA11 tires that have production-date codes from 2021. A full-size spare resides in the trunk. Ireland Engineering springs and sway bars were installed under previous ownership along with Bilstein shocks and stainless-steel brake lines. Stopping power is provided by power-assisted front disc and rear drum brakes.",
      "The front bucket seats were reupholstered in black vinyl in 2021, and matching upholstery extends to the rear bench and door panels. Replacement carpeting lines the floor and trunk area, and amenities include a Blaupunkt AM/FM stereo, a dash-mounted analog clock, a heater, and crank-operated windows. The heater box was overhauled under previous ownership. The rear portion of the chrome trim on the passenger door is missing.",
      "The three-spoke steering wheel fronts VDO instrumentation that consists of a 120-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 6,400-rpm redline as well as gauges for fuel level and coolant temperature. The five-digit odometer shows 5,500 miles, approximately 2,500 of which were added by the seller. True mileage is unknown.",
      "A replacement 2.0-liter M10 inline-four was installed during time with a previous owner. It is said to have been rebuilt prior to installation and features Kugelfischer mechanical fuel injection and a PerTronix ignition system. Work circa 2020 included adjusting the valves and replacing the fuel lift pump, injection pump, injectors, and lines along with the throttle body, water pump, radiator, and various coolant hoses. The engine mounts were replaced under current ownership.",
      "Power is routed to the rear wheels via a four-speed manual transmission. The muffler was replaced in July 2021 and the fuel tank was replaced under current ownership.",
      "The window sticker shows initial delivery to Helmut’s Small Car Service of Bridgeport, Connecticut, and lists factory equipment and options along with a total suggested price of $4,725.45. Manufacturer’s literature, service manuals, a BMW 2002-branded car cover, and floor mats will accompany the car. Service records dating to 1972 can be viewed in the gallery."

      "This dune buggy was constructed in a George Barris Mini-T-Style and features a fiberglass body mounted to a modified Volkswagen chassis. The car spent time in California and was refurbished under previous ownership before it was acquired by the seller in 2021. Finished in Nostalgic Maroon Metallic over tan leather, it is powered by an air-cooled 2,109cc flat-four paired with a four-speed manual transaxle. Equipment includes a removable tan soft top, dual Dellorto carburetors, a four-into-four exhaust system, a chrome-finished narrowed front beam, chrome rear coilovers, four-wheel disc brakes, 15″ alloy wheels, Mickey Thompson tires, a wood-rimmed Grant GT steering wheel, a CNC pedal assembly, and a Hurst shifter. This dune buggy is offered at no reserve with a build summary and a Connecticut registration listing the car as a 1963 Volkswagen.",
      "The fiberglass bodywork was refinished under previous ownership in Nostalgic Maroon Metallic. Exterior details include a removable tan soft top, a hood ornament, low-profile headlights, billet-aluminum side mirrors, a wine glass-themed rear window, a chrome fuel filler cap, and teardrop taillights.",
      "Polished and staggered 15″ Jegs Performance Sport Star alloy wheels are wrapped in Mickey Thompson tires. The suspension features a chrome-finished 2″ narrowed front beam, 2.5″ drop spindles, and chrome shocks at the front joined by a torsion bar setup with chrome spring plates and preload-adjustable coilovers in the rear. Braking is handled by four-wheel discs.",
      "The individual seats are upholstered in tan leather that extends to the side panels. Additional appointments include a CNC pedal assembly with a hydraulically actuated clutch as well as a chrome-finished top frame, a Hurst shifter, and tan carpets. A spare steering wheel is included in the sale.",
      "The wood-rimmed Grant GT steering wheel fronts a body-color dashboard that houses a Dolphin speedometer while matching auxiliary gauges for fuel level, oil pressure, and voltage are housed in the body-color pod atop the central tunnel. The six-digit odometer shows 3,900 miles.",
      "The air-cooled 2,109cc flat-four features an Eagle 2242 mild street camshaft, dual Dellorto carburetors, a polished four-into-four stainless-steel exhaust system, body-color cooling tins, hex-bar throttle linkage, billet aluminum pulleys, a spin-on oil filter, and an Odyssey battery. An oil change was completed in preparation for the sale.",
      "Power is delivered to the rear wheels through a rebuilt four-speed manual transaxle. Work under previous ownership included media blasting the chassis and adding 2″ steel reinforcement rails to the pan and body before coating the underside with rust inhibitor.",
      "The current Connecticut registration carries an “Antique” designation in the Registered Usage section."

      "This 1966 Triumph TR4A was acquired by its previous owner in 1996 and subsequently modified. The car was refinished in Signal Red, and its replacement 2,138cc inline-four was rebuilt and fitted with a Moss supercharger. A Moss aluminum head, a Wizard Cooling radiator, and an aluminum flywheel were also installed along with a stainless-steel exhaust system, and the steering and suspension systems were overhauled. The car also has black leather upholstery on the bucket seats, a color-coordinated soft top and tonneau, and 15″ wire wheels, Wilwood front disc brakes, fiddleback walnut dashboard, wool carpeting, and a Lecarra steering wheel. Acquired by the selling dealer in 2024, this supercharged TR4 is now offered in Oregon with the owner’s manual, service records, spare parts, a car cover, and a clean Washington title.",
      "The TR4A was built from 1965 to 1967 and featured a revised grille and a widened chassis compared with earlier TR4 models. The Giovanni Michelotti-designed body has been repainted Signal Red and features a black convertible soft top, a tonneau cover, a Triplex windshield, a driver-side mirror, a flip-up fuel-filler cap, turn signals on the front fender sides, LED tail lights, and chrome bumpers with overriders. There is a dent on the right-front fender.",
      "The 15″ wire wheels are mounted with 165/80 Nexen SB802 tires. Wilwood front disc brakes mounted on alloy hubs were installed in 2021, at which time the springs, trailing arm brackets, and bushings were replaced. A replacement steering rack and Good Parts CV axle joints have also been fitted, according to the selling dealer.",
      "The cabin houses bucket seats upholstered in black leather with white piping, and interior appointments include a locking glovebox, a cabin heater, seat belts, storage pockets, and a rear parcel shelf.",
      "The Lecarra steering wheel sits ahead of a fiddleback walnut dashboard with Jaeger instrumentation. A Smiths boost-pressure gauge and electric clock have been installed. The five-digit odometer shows 57k miles, though total mileage is unknown.",
      "The 2,138cc inline-four was rebuilt in 2002 with an earlier block and a Moss aluminum head, and the Moss supercharger was installed in 2011. A spin-on oil filter, 45-amp alternator, Mallory distributor, and electric fuel pump with an external Fram filter were also installed, and the aluminum radiator is cooled by a SPAL fan. The hood is supported by struts when open and has a redundant release.",
      "Power is routed to the rear wheels through a four-speed manual transmission. An aluminum flywheel and a stainless-steel exhaust system have been installed.",
      "The commission plate is a replacement, and the removed tag is included in the sale and presented in the gallery below.",
      "Records are included in the sale along with jacking equipment, a car cover, and a “big-boost” kit that includes a bigger pulley for the supercharger and a longer belt."

Equipment includes a Stromberg 94 carburetor, an Ansen intake manifold, mechanical drum brakes, red-painted 21″ wire-spoke wheels, a running board-mounted spotlight, and bucket seats trimmed in burgundy upholstery. This Model A Speedster is now offered in Marietta, Georgia, with a conditional Georgia title.",

Equipment includes a gold miner hood ornament, a top-hinged hood with missing side panels, a tubular windscreen frame, red #59 roundels, running boards with a mounted spotlight and storage boxes, dual taillights, and a chrome exhaust tip.",
      "Red-painted wire-spoke wheels wear chrome Ford-branded covers, and they are mounted with 4.40/4.50–21 Lester whitewall bias-ply tires. A matching spare wheel is stowed under the rear lid along with the fuel tank and battery. The car features front and rear solid axles with transverse leaf springs, and stopping power is provided by mechanical drums.",

The five-digit odometer shows under 1k miles, approximately 20 of which were added by the selling dealer. Total mileage is unknown.",

      "This 2007 Aston Martin V8 Vantage has 34k miles following registration history in California, and it was purchased by its current owner in December 2016. Finished in Midnight Blue over Caspian Blue and Sandstorm leather, the car is powered by a 4.3-liter V8 paired with a six-speed manual transaxle. Equipment includes 19″ seven-spoke alloy wheels, a limited-slip differential, a back-up camera, heated power-adjustable seats, navigation, and automatic climate control. This V8 Vantage is now offered at no reserve on dealer consignment as part of Mohr Imports’ Monterey Car Week Collection with service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean California title.",
      "The car is finished in Midnight Blue and features an integrated rear spoiler, hood vents, LED taillights, and dual exhaust tips.",
      "The 19″ seven-spoke alloy wheels are mounted with Continental ExtremeContact tires. Braking is from Aston Martin-branded red calipers over slotted rotors at all four corners.",
      "The cabin is trimmed in Caspian Blue and Sandstorm leather and features heated power-adjustable seats. Additional features include seat-position memory, a back-up camera, navigation, a CD stereo, aluminum pedals, and automatic climate control.",
      "The three-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a 220-mph speedometer, a reverse-sweep tachometer, and gauges for fuel level and coolant temperature. The digital odometer indicates 34k miles, approximately 4k of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The 4.3-liter V8 was factory rated at 380 horsepower and 302 lb-ft of torque, which is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. An oil change was performed in preparation for the sale.",
      "The Carfax report is free from accidents or other reported damage."

    "description": [
      "This 1993 Jaguar XJ220 is one of approximately 280 examples built during two years of production and was manufactured on June 18, 1993. It was delivered to its first owner via Jaguar Deutschland GmbH on January 24, 1994, and placed into storage until 2002. It was sent to Don Law Jaguar in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, for service that year before it was first imported to the US. It later returned to Don Law Jaguar for additional service in 2016 before it was reimported to the US under a Show or Display exemption in 2017. It won awards at the Jaguar Club of Florida Concours d’Elegance and Hilton Head Island Concours d’Elegance in 2021 and was purchased by the current owner in 2022. The aluminum bodywork is finished in Spa Silver over Charcoal leather, and power comes from a twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V6 mated to a five-speed manual transaxle with a limited-slip differential. Additional features include a bonded aluminum chassis, a glass roof panel, AP Racing brake, staggered-diameter Speedline wheels, air conditioning, and an Alpine stereo with a trunk-mounted CD changer. This XJ220 shows 1,150 kilometers (~700 miles) and is now offered on dealer consignment in Lancaster, New York, with factory literature, tools, Project XJ220 Limited correspondence, a Jaguar Heritage Trust certificate, import documents, service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Florida title.",
      "The XJ220 was developed in collaboration with Tom Walkinshaw Racing based on an all-wheel-drive, V12-powered concept that was shown at the 1988 British International Motor Show. The production version shared the prototype’s bonded aluminum honeycomb chassis but was shortened in wheelbase and overall length. A rally-derived V6 was fitted in place of the concept’s larger engine and powered the rear wheels exclusively. The XJ220 set a production-car record with a top speed of 212.3 mph in stock form during 1991 testing before entering production the following year. An XJ220 with its catalytic converters removed then raised the record to 217.1 mph in June 1992.",
      "Aluminum bodywork was constructed by Abbey Panels, Ltd. of Coventry, England. This example was delivered from the factory in Spa Silver and features a front air dam, retractable headlight covers, louvers at the base of the windshield and rear window to stabilize airflow, underbody venturi tunnels that extend into a rear diffuser, electrically adjustable side mirrors, intake scoops aft of the doors, a glass roof panel, and a trunk-mounted rear spoiler.",
      "Speedline Corse-designed alloy wheels measure 17” up front and 18” at the rear and are secured by center-lock nuts. Bridgestone Potenza S007 tires showing 2017 date codes were reportedly sourced from Don Law and mounted in 2019. The XJ220 rides on a 103.9″ wheelbase and features a fully independent suspension with unequal-length wishbones at all four corners. Stopping power is provided by AP Racing-designed four-piston aluminum calipers mounted over cross-drilled and ventilated discs measuring 13” in diameter up front and 11.8” out back.",
      "The left-hand-drive cabin features manually adjustable bolstered sport seats trimmed in Charcoal leather with perforated inserts as well as a color-coordinated center console, door panels, and roof pillars. Color-matched carpeting covers the floors, while black microsuede accents the kick panels and doors. Additional amenities include air conditioning, power windows, and an Alpine cassette player with a trunk-mounted CD changer.",
      "The four-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel sits ahead of a 360-km/h speedometer, a tachometer with a 7k-rpm redline, and gauges monitoring oil pressure and temperature, coolant temperature, and fuel level. The instrument binnacle extends over the adjacent door panel, where a clock, an ammeter, and gauges showing boost pressure and transaxle temperature are housed. The six-digit odometer shows 1,150 kilometers (~700 miles), and approximately 21 kilometers have been added under current ownership.",
      "The 3.5-liter JV6 V6 was developed by Jaguar and TWR based on the Austin Rover V64V used in the MG Metro 6R4 Group B rally car. Shared by Jaguar’s XJR-10 and XJR-11 racing cars, the JV6 features twin Garrett turbochargers with corresponding air-to-air intercoolers, an aluminum block and cylinder heads, dual overhead camshafts on each bank, four valves per cylinder, dry-sump lubrication, multipoint fuel injection with dual injectors, and Zytek electronic engine management. Factory-rated output was 542 horsepower and 475 lb-ft of torque.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a five-speed manual transaxle equipped with a limited-slip differential.",
      "The Jaguar Heritage Trust Production Record Trace Certificate lists factory colors and component numbers as well as a June 18, 1993, production date.

    "description": [
      "This 1996 Porsche Carrera RS is one of approximately 1,014 examples produced for the 1995 and 1996 model years and was delivered new to Porsche Zentrum Bamberg in Germany. The car is finished in black over black and gray multi-tone leather upholstery, and power comes from a replacement 3.8-liter flat-six mated to a replacement G50/30 six-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. RS Clubsport-style spoilers have been added along with a welded-in roll cage, OMP multi-point harnesses, and a fire-suppression system. Further equipment includes a seam-welded body shell, an aluminum hood, 18″ Speedline multi-piece wheels, a front strut tower bar, Recaro seats, air conditioning, power windows, and a Blaupunkt CD stereo. The car is said to have been acquired by the current owner in 2001 from its first owner, after which it was relocated to France. A top-end reseal was reportedly carried out in April 2024, and further work performed since 2022 involved fitting a competition clutch as well as replacing the mufflers and fuel pump. This 993 Carrera RS is offered on dealer consignment in Aubenas, France with a service manual and French registration.",
      "The 993 RS Carrera is a lightweight variant of the Carrera that was introduced for the 1995 model year and featured a seam-welded body shell, an aluminum hood, deleted headlight washers, and thinner glass compared to the contemporary Carrera. This example left the factory in black (L741) and has been fitted with RS Clubsport-style spoilers. Further exterior details include hood and decklid pins, Carrera RS decklid badging, side marker lamps, and dual exhaust outlets. The seller states that the car was involved in a collision with another vehicle in the early 2000s and the right door and rear fender have been refinished. There is a scratch on the driver’s door, and stone chips are visible along the front bumper cover and fenders, hood, and side mirrors. A selection of paint meter readings are provided in the photo gallery below.",
      "Silver 18″ multi-piece Speedline wheels feature RS center caps and are mounted with Michelin Pilot Sport Cup tires that measure 225/40 up front and 275/35 out back, the latter of which were installed in May 2024. A factory-optioned strut bar spans the front trunk, which houses a space-saver spare. Stopping power is provided by red four-piston calipers over cross-drilled and ventilated discs at each corner.",
      "The cabin houses replacement fixed-back Recaro seats trimmed in black leather with gray multi-tone centers and fitted with OMP multi-point harnesses that are attached to the partially padded roll cage. Additional modifications consist of a fire-suppression system, TechArt drilled pedals, checker-plate flooring in the driver’s footwell, and a Blaupunkt CD stereo, while factory appointments include air conditioning, power windows, and a front passenger airbag. Wear is visible on the shift knob.",
      "The microsuede-wrapped MOMO steering wheel features a yellow centering stripe and fronts a central tachometer flanked by a quartz clock and combination gauges. The six-digit odometer shows 194k kilometers (~121k miles). The speedometer was removed and repaired in preparation of the sale, and total mileage is unknown. The seller states that the removed factory steering wheel will accompany the sale.",
      "The M64/20 flat-six was enlarged to 3.8 liters for the Carrera RS and features a VarioRam intake system, forged pistons, lightened rocker arms, enlarged intake valves, and Bosch Motronic engine management. It was factory rated at 300 horsepower, and the engine in this example was replaced under previous ownership. The fuel pump was replaced in August 2023 and the seller notes that a top-end reseal was performed in April 2024.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels via a G50/30 six-speed manual transaxle that was installed under previous ownership and a limited-slip differential. A competition clutch was installed in July 2022, at which time the clutch pedal stop and release bearing were replaced. A pair of stainless-steel sport mufflers were fitted in April 2024 and the wheel arch liners were also replaced at each corner. Scrapes are visible along the underside.",
      "The maintenance booklet indicates that the car was first sold in Germany in August 1995, and decoding the options sticker provides the following information:",
      "The vehicle is being sold on its French registration, which lists the first registration date as August 1, 1995. The sale does not include a title, as the vehicle is registered in a country that does not issue titles for vehicles."

      "This 2001 Ferrari 550 Maranello is a Canadian-market example that shows 9k kilometers (~6k miles), and it was registered in Ontario prior to being imported into the United States in June 2020. Finished in Giallo Modena over Nero leather, the car is powered by a 5.5-liter V12 paired with a six-speed manual transaxle. The car is equipped with a limited-slip differential, a Tubi-Style exhaust system, 18″ five-spoke alloy wheels, fog lights, Scuderia Ferrari fender shields, power-adjustable Daytona-style seats, a gated shifter, a CD stereo, and automatic climate control. The tires have been replaced and the oil changed in preparation for the sale. This 550 Maranello is now offered in Florida by the selling dealer at no reserve with the owner’s manual, service records, a car cover, tools, a clean Carfax report, and a Montana title.",
      "The 550 Maranello was styled by Pininfarina, and this example is finished in Giallo Modena. Equipment includes projector-style headlights, fog lights, a hood scoop, a front spoiler, front fender vents, Scuderia Ferrari fender shields, and quad exhaust tips exiting through the rear bumper cover.",
      "The 18″ five-spoke alloy wheels wear 255/40 front and 295/35 rear Pirelli P Zero Rosso tires that were fitted in July 2024. Braking is handled by red-finished Ferrari-branded calipers over cross-drilled and ventilated rotors at all four corners.",
      "The cabin features power-adjustable Daytona-style seats upholstered in Nero leather. Amenities include a gated shifter, automatic climate control, electric windows, a CD stereo, a hi-fi sound system, and rear luggage straps. Sticky surfaces were refinished in June 2020.",
      "The leather-wrapped three-spoke steering wheel fronts a Jaeger gauge cluster with a 340-km/h speedometer and a tachometer with a 7,600-rpm redline as well as gauges for coolant temperature and oil pressure, while an analog clock and gauges for oil temperature and fuel level are located atop the center stack. The six-digit odometer shows 9k kilometers (~6k miles).",

      "This Shelby Cobra is a CSX4000 continuation model that was completed on July 26, 2005, and delivered to S/C Motorsports of Mustang, Oklahoma. Power is provided by a side-oiler Ford V8 that has reportedly been stroked to displace 468ci and paired with a David Kee Toploader four-speed manual transmission. The fiberglass bodywork is finished in Guardsman Blue with Wimbledon White center stripes, and features include Halibrand-style knock-off wheels, four-wheel disc brakes, independent suspension, side exhaust pipes, a chrome roll hoop, latch-and-link lap belts, and a wood-rimmed steering wheel. Acquired by the seller in January 2022, this CSX4000 was previously offered on BaT in June 2023 and is now offered again in Florida with a clean Montana title in the name of the seller’s LLC listing it as a 1965 Shelby Cobra.",
      "The fiberglass bodywork is finished in Guardsman Blue with Wimbledon White center stripes and mounted on a 4″ round-tube steel frame with a 90″ wheelbase. Exterior details include quick-jack bumperettes, a hood scoop, Shelby 427 S/C-badging, fender vents, wind wings, a single roll hoop, a Le Mans-style fuel filler, and side-exit exhaust pipes. Paint chips and scratches are visible on the front end.",
      "Halibrand-style 15″ wheels are secured with safety-wired three-eared knockoffs and are mounted with 26.5×8″ front and 26.5×10.5″ rear Goodyear Eagle Sport Car Special tires with billboard-style lettering. The car rides on four-wheel independent suspension with coilovers and rack-and-pinion steering. Stopping power is provided by four-wheel disc brakes.",
      "The low-back bucket seats are trimmed in black leather and joined by a color-coordinated dashboard, door panels, and carpeting. Interior elements include a dashboard-mounted rearview mirror, Crow Enterprizes latch-and-link lap belts, tinted sunvisors, and a battery cut-off switch.",
      "Shelby-branded instrumentation includes a reverse-sweep 180-mph speedometer, a tachometer, and gauges for monitoring oil pressure, oil temperature, coolant temperature, amperage, and fuel level. The five-digit mechanical odometer shows 3,200 miles, approximately 900 of which were added under current ownership. The fuel level gauge has been replaced.",
      "The side-oiler Ford V8 is said to be a 1965 model that was rebuilt and stroked to displace 468ci by Geesford Machine of Hastings, Nebraska. It features dual 540-cfm Holley four-barrel carburetors, Shelby-branded valve covers, MSD ignition components, and an aluminum radiator with an electric fan. Additional equipment reportedly includes a COMP Cams solid-roller camshaft, Edelbrock aluminum cylinder heads, Arias pistons, Dove roller rocker arms, Stelling and Hellings air cleaners, and a Blue Thunder intake manifold. Service performed in 2023 is said to have involved replacing the battery and changing the oil. Images of the engine numbers and casting stamps are viewable in the previous auction gallery.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a Ford Toploader four-speed manual transmission that was built by David Kee of San Antonio, Texas. The rear differential is said to be equipped with 3.54:1 gearing.",
      "The chassis number CSX4780 shown above matches the VIN listed on the current Montana title, which describes the car as a 1965 Shelby Cobra."

      "This 1990 Ferrari 348 TS shows 21k miles following registration history in Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico. Finished in Nero over Cream Connolly leather, the car is powered by a 3.4-liter DOHC V8 paired with a dogleg five-speed manual transaxle. Features include a Fabspeed exhaust system, a removable roof panel, 17″ five-spoke alloy wheels, a limited-slip differential, a gated shifter, air conditioning, and power windows. This 348 is now offered by the selling dealer with the owner’s manual, service records, a tool kit, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Colorado title.",
      "The 348 was the final V8-powered Ferrari model developed under the direction of Enzo Ferrari, and its design was overseen by Pininfarina chief stylist Leonardo Fioravanti. This example is finished in Nero with black lower-body panels and features a removable black roof panel, pop-up headlights, fog lights, side air intakes, louvered taillights, and quad exhaust tips. Close-up photos of imperfections are included in the gallery.",
      "The 17″ five-spoke alloy wheels are mounted with Continental ExtremeContact DWS 06 Plus tires, which were fitted in November 2021. Stopping power is provided by Ferrari-branded calipers over ventilated discs along with an anti-lock system.",
      "The cabin features two seats upholstered in Cream Connolly leather along with a matching center console, lower dashboard, and door panel inserts. Equipment includes a dogleg-pattern gated shifter, a heated rear window, a Boss amplifier, Pioneer speakers, and power windows and door locks. The air conditioning system was converted to R134a refrigerant in June 2020.",
      "The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames Veglia Borletti instrumentation including a 200-mph speedometer, a tachometer with a 7,500-rpm redline, and gauges for coolant temperature and oil pressure. Auxiliary gauges for oil temperature and fuel level are mounted in the center stack. The six-digit odometer shows 21k miles, approximately 300 of which have been added by the seller.",
      "The 3.4-liter quad-cam Tipo F119 V8 features Bosch Motronic engine management and was factory rated at 296 horsepower and 229 lb-ft of torque. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a five-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. A belt service was performed in June 2020 by European Auto Service in Palm Desert, California. Additional work at that time included installing a Fabspeed exhaust system and replacing the water pump, fuel sending unit, and valve cover gaskets.",
      "The Carfax report is free from accidents or other reported damage."

      "This 2001 Honda Prelude is a Type SH example that is finished in Satin Silver Metallic over black cloth upholstery and is powered by a 2.2-liter inline-four paired with a five-speed manual transaxle. Now showing 47k miles, it is further equipped with an Active Torque Transfer System, 16″ alloy wheels, a rear spoiler, a ground effects kit, a power-operated sunroof, air conditioning, cruise control, and a CD stereo. The water pump as well as the timing and clutch components were replaced before the car was acquired by the selling dealer in May 2023, and work performed since then involved changing the oil and brake fluid, repainting various body panels, and replacing the valve cover gaskets. This Prelude Type SH is now offered by the selling dealer in Florida with manufacturer’s literature, partial service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Massachusetts title.",
      "The car is finished in Satin Silver Metallic (NH623M), and the hood, and front and rear bumper covers were reportedly repainted under current ownership, and the seller states that the right rear quarter panel was repainted under prior ownership. Details include black and silver pinstripes, a power-operated glass sunroof, power-adjustable mirrors, a rear spoiler, and a ground effects kit.",
      "Silver-finished 16″ five-spoke alloy wheels are mounted with 205/50 Evoluxx Capricorn UHP tires. The SH “Super Handling” model featured an Active Torque Transfer System along with firmer springs, shocks, and anti-roll bars than the standard Prelude. Braking is provided by four-wheel discs, and a brake fluid flush was performed in preparation for the sale.",
      "The front bucket seats and a bolstered rear bench seat are upholstered in black cloth with patterned inserts and are complemented by a color-coordinated dashboard, center console, and door panels. Honda-branded floor mats line the footwells, and appointments include air conditioning, cruise control, and an AM/FM/CD stereo.",
      "The leather-wrapped steering wheel is mounted on a tilting column and frames a 150-mph speedometer, a tachometer, and auxiliary gauges for coolant temperature and fuel level. The six-digit odometer shows 47k miles, approximately 100 of which have been added by the selling dealer.",
      "The 2.2-liter DOHC inline-four features VTEC variable valve timing and was factory rated at 200 horsepower and 156 lb-ft of torque. The water pump, drive belts, and timing belt components were replaced in May 2022, and an oil change was performed and the valve cover gaskets were replaced in preparation for the sale.",
      "Power is delivered to the front wheels via a five-speed manual transaxle. Clutch components were replaced in May 2022, and rust is noted on underside components.",
      "The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage."

      "This 1965 Pontiac Grand Prix is said to have been purchased new by a General Motors employee from Jenny Pontiac of Janesville, Wisconsin and remained in their family until 2015. The car is finished in Iris Mist over Plum vinyl upholstery, and power comes from a 389ci V8 paired with a three-speed automatic transmission. Equipment includes a four-barrel carburetor, power-assisted steering and drum brakes, 14″ eight-lug aluminum wheels, a black vinyl roof, front bucket seats, a center console, and a push-button AM/FM radio with Bluetooth compatibility. This Grand Prix Sports Coupe was purchased by the current owner in 2022, and it is now offered on dealer consignment as part of the Mohr Imports’ Monterey Car Week Collection with spare parts, an owner’s manual, a reproduction window sticker, PHS documentation, service records, a set of California black plates, a car cover, and a clean California title.",
      "The car was delivered from the factory in Iris Mist (P), a color offered exclusively on Pontiacs exclusively for the 1965 model year. Features include chrome bumpers and trim, stacked quad headlights, dual side mirrors, a black vinyl roof, rear fender skirts, taillight louvers, reverse lamps, and polished exhaust finishers.",
      "Aluminum eight-lug wheels wear Pontiac Motor Division center caps, and they are mounted with 215/T5R14 Firestone whitewall radial tires. A matching spare wheel with a Uniroyal tire is stowed under a cover in the trunk. The car was equipped from the factory with Wonder Touch power-assisted steering and power four-wheel drum brakes. Three painted steel wheels, five chrome Pontiac Motor Division hubcaps, and four spare finned brake drums are included in the sale.",

Corrosion in the trunk is shown in the gallery.",
      "The two-spoke steering wheel fronts a 120-mph speedometer. A clock and gauges for fuel level and battery charge are located in the center of the dash, while a manifold vacuum gauge is mounted on the center console. Additional readouts for water temperature and oil pressure are installed below the dash. The five-digit odometer shows 19k miles, approximately 4k of which were added by the current owner.",
      "The 389ci V8 features five main bearings and a four-barrel carburetor, and it was factory rated at 325 horsepower and 425 lb-ft of torque.",

      "This 2014 Porsche 911 Turbo S coupe is powered by a twin-turbocharged 3.8L flat-six that drives all four wheels through a seven-speed PDK dual-clutch transaxle, and it is finished in white over black and Carrera Red leather. Equipment includes the Sport Chrono and Light Design Packages along with 20″ Turbo S center-lock alloy wheels, H&R lowering springs, Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes, an electronic limited-slip rear differential, LED headlights, Park Assist, Racing Yellow seat belts, carbon-fiber interior trim, illuminated carbon-fiber door sill plates, Bose audio, and PCM with navigation. The car was previously listed on BaT in September 2022 and was acquired by the seller the following month. This 991.1 Turbo S has 13k miles and is offered with a window sticker, an owner’s manual, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Arizona title in the seller’s name.",
      "The car is finished in white and has LED headlights, clear side markers, a power sunroof, quarter panel air intakes, a speed-activated rear spoiler, and quad exhaust outlets. Clear paint protection film has been applied to the front end and rocker panels.",
      "The 20″ Turbo S center-lock alloy wheels are wrapped in 245/35 front and 305/35 rear Michelin Pilot Sport tires that were mounted under current ownership. Braking is handled by Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes (PCCB) featuring yellow-painted Porsche-branded calipers at all four corners. Rear-axle steering and Porsche Dynamic Chassis Control (PDCC) were standard equipment on the Turbo S. The car is also equipped with Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM). H&R lowering springs were installed in January 2023.",
      "The cabin is trimmed in Carrera Red and black leather and features a microsuede headliner, Racing Yellow seatbelts, and carbon-fiber accents on the dash, center console, door panels, and illuminated door sills. Amenities include power-adjustable front seats, cruise control, dual-zone automatic climate control, a Bose sound system, and Porsche Communication Management with navigation.",
      "The three-spoke SportDesign steering wheel frames a central tachometer with a 7k-rpm redline as well as a 225-mph speedometer and gauges for coolant temperature, oil temperature, oil pressure, and fuel level. The Sport Chrono Package added a stopwatch atop the dashboard. The digital odometer indicates 13k miles, approximately 1,500 of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The twin-turbocharged 3.8L flat-six features aluminum construction and direct fuel injection. Factory-rated output was 560 horsepower and 516 lb-ft of torque, and the Sport Chrono Package adds an over-boost function that temporarily raises peak torque to 553 lb-ft. The radiator is said to have been replaced in 2022, and an oil change was performed in January 2023.",
      "Power is sent to all four wheels via a seven-speed PDK dual-clutch transaxle and an electronically locking rear differential with Porsche Torque Vectoring Plus.",
      "The window sticker lists initial delivery to Porsche of the Fox Valley in Appleton, Wisconsin, along with factory equipment, colors, options, and a total price of $186,695. An owner’s manual and two key fobs will accompany the car.",
      "The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage."

Additional modifications include a front strut-tower brace, an alarm system, and Euro-style headlamps. The car was acquired by the owner on BaT in March 2021, and subsequent work consisted of replacing the smog pump belt and drive gear and resealing the turbo oil supply pipe at the engine case. This 930 Turbo shows 50k miles and is now offered on dealer consignment with partial service records, a tire inflator, a tool kit, a fire extinguisher, a clean Carfax report, and a clean California title.",

      "This 1935 Ford five-window coupe was refurbished and modified under prior ownership with work that included a repaint in two-tone blue, a custom interior re-trim in black cloth, and installation of a Chevrolet 350ci V8 paired with a three-speed automatic transmission. Equipment includes an Edelbrock carburetor, intake manifold, and cylinder heads as well as a rumble seat, front disc brakes, staggered-width 15″ steel wheels, Stewart-Warner gauges, a blade-style fuse panel, a tilting steering column, and chrome bumpers and trim. This five-window coupe was acquired by the selling dealer in 2024 and is now offered with a Washington title.",
      "The car is finished in two-tone blue with black running board covers and chrome accents. There is a crack atop the left-rear quarter panel running into the rumble-seat seam. Other paint chips and imperfections are pictured in the gallery below, and bubbling is noted at the lower leading edge of each rear fender.",
      "The car rides on transverse leaf springs front and rear, and braking is handled by power-assisted front discs and rear drums. Black-finished 15″ steel wheels are mounted with Nexen tires measuring 165/80 up front and 215/75 out back. A spare wire wheel is surrounded by a blue-finished cover and mounted to the rear panel.",
      "The interior is trimmed in black cloth upholstery along with coordinated carpets. A B&M floor shifter is installed along with a tilting steering column and an aftermarket wiring harness with a blade-style fuse panel.",
      "The rumble seat is trimmed in blue vinyl upholstery.",
      "Stewart-Warner instrumentation consists of a 120-mph speedometer flanked by gauges for amps, water temperature, oil pressure, and fuel level. A clock and a transmission-temperature gauge are mounted below the dash. The five-digit odometer shows 16k miles. True mileage is unknown.",
      "The 350ci Chevrolet V8 features an Edelbrock four-barrel carburetor, aluminum intake manifold, and Performer RPM aluminum cylinder heads. A Mallory distributor and ignition coil are installed, and coated headers feed into a dual exhaust system with side outlets ahead of each rear wheel.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a three-speed automatic transmission and a 12-bolt rear axle.",
      "The car is titled in Washington using the assigned identification number 181574190. The Washington title carries an Antique brand."

      "This 1970 Alfa Romeo 1750 Spider Veloce is a late-run Series I example that was built to US-market specification and then delivered new to Frankfurt, Germany, in May 1970. The car was subsequently brought to the US and spent time in Ohio, where it underwent a multi-year refurbishment by Wedgewood Sports & Imports from 2011 to 2019. Work at that time involved a repaint, suspension and brake overhauls, and rebuilds of the 1.8L twin-cam inline-four and five-speed manual transmission, and a subsequent interior re-trim was carried out in 2023 prior to the current owner’s acquisition. The car is finished in red over tan leather upholstery and wears Carello headlamp covers as well as a Haartz black convertible top and a black vinyl top boot. The engine is fitted with dual Weber DCOE carburetors along with International Auto Parts (IAP) performance camshafts, and further equipment includes KYB shocks, Centerline springs, and 14″ GTA-style alloy wheels. This boat-tail Spider Veloce is now offered on dealer consignment with 2013 correspondence from Automobilismo Storico Centro Documentazione, refurbishment records, and a clean Wisconsin title listing the car as a 1969 model.",
      "The Pininfarina-designed bodywork is said to have been stripped and repainted in red as part of the aforementioned refurbishment. Replacement Carello headlamp covers have been added, and a Haartz black convertible top is paired with a black vinyl top boot. Further details include dual side mirrors, split stainless-steel bumpers, and a single polished exhaust outlet.",

      "This 1968 Suzuki TC250 X-6 Scrambler is powered by a 247cc two-stroke parallel twin mated to a six-speed transmission, and it was repainted in metallic blue and silver as part of a refurbishment that took place in 2015. The bike is equipped with a kick starter, a pair of 24mm Mikuni carburetors, Suzuki’s Posi-Force lubrication system, and a chrome-finished two-into-two exhaust system with perforated heat shields as well as 18″ wire-spoke wheels, drum brakes, a friction-type steering damper, a black vinyl two-up seat, and both center and side stands. The seller acquired the bike in 2022, and work in 2024 has included flushing the fuel system, rebuilding the petcock and oil pump, cleaning and synchronizing the carburetors, and replacing the battery, spark plugs, control cables, and tires. This TC250 is now offered at no reserve with an owner’s manual, a service guide, a tool kit, and a clean Texas title in the seller’s name.",
      "The 3.7-gallon fuel tank, fenders, and side covers were refinished in metallic blue and silver as part of the aforementioned 2015 refurbishment. Chrome side panels with rubber knee grips accent the fuel tank, and additional details include a black vinyl two-up seat, a grab strap, a chrome-rimmed headlight bucket, folding passenger foot pegs, and both center and side stands. Decals have been applied to the rear fender just behind the seat, and blemishes on various body panels are identified by the seller in a video provided in the gallery.",
      "Wire-spoke wheels with 18″ chrome-finished rims were mounted with Duro tires and replacement inner tubes in 2024. Braking is handled by drums at both ends, and suspension consists of a conventional telescopic fork with black accordion gaiters as well as a pair of chrome-housed shocks mounted to the swingarm. The fork oil was changed in 2024.",
      "The chrome cross-braced handlebar carries a single round mirror on the left and is situated just ahead of the adjustment knob for the friction-type steering damper. Instrumentation housed in the headlight bucket consists of a 120-mph speedometer and a tachometer with an 8k-rpm redline. The vertical five-digit odometer shows 4k miles, approximately 500 of which were ridden by the seller. The cables for the throttle, clutch, and front brake were replaced in 2024.",
      "The 247cc two-stroke parallel twin features Suzuki’s Posi-Force lubrication system as well as a kick starter, a pair of 24mm Mikuni carburetors, and a chrome-finished two-into-two exhaust system with perforated heat shields. Factory-rated output was 29 horsepower and 20 lb-ft of torque. Work completed since the beginning of 2024 has included flushing the fuel tank, adjusting the timing, rebuilding the petcock and oil pump, and cleaning and synchronizing the carburetors as well as replacing the battery, spark plugs, and fuel lines.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheel through a six-speed constant-mesh transmission and a drive chain. The transmission received a fluid change in 2024.",
      "A tool kit, an owner’s manual, and a service guide will accompany the motorcycle.",
      "The Texas title lists the model year as 1969 and also lists “VIN Certification Waived” under the “Remarks” heading."

      "This 1950 Willys-Overland Jeepster was modified under prior ownership with custom bodywork, a removable hardtop, and a body-color tonneau cover along with a fuel-injected 350ci V8 and a five-speed manual transmission. The truck is finished in metallic blue and rides on Mustang II-style independent front suspension, rear airbags, and staggered-diameter Cragar SS wheels. The interior houses two-tone bucket seats along with a custom dash and center console, a CD stereo, and gauges sourced from a Pontiac Trans Am. Service completed in 2023 included replacing the fuel tank and clutch assembly. This modified Jeepster is now offered by the selling dealer in Idaho with service records and a Washington title.",
      "The vehicle features custom bodywork finished in metallic blue, including a rear roll pan, shaved door handles, and body-color molded fenders and running boards. A firewall was added behind the front seats, and the rear cargo area is topped with a body-color tonneau cover. Rectangular headlights and teardrop taillights were also installed along with a custom grille, wind wings, aftermarket mirrors, and a removable hardtop. Exhaust outlets exit ahead of each rear wheel. Scratches are shown up close in the gallery.",
      "The 14″ front and 15″ rear Cragar SS wheels feature faux-knockoffs and are wrapped in BFGoodrich Radial T/A tires measuring 205/70 and 255/70 respectively. The Mustang II-style independent front suspension incorporates disc brakes, while the rear end features airbags and drums. Maintenance on the rear brakes included replacing the wheel cylinders, shoes, and drums in 2023. The brake fluid was also flushed.",
      "The bucket seats are trimmed in blue vinyl and cloth, and the cabin features fabric door panels, matching carpets, and a custom body-color dash and center console. Amenities include a Sony CD stereo, aftermarket pedals, and a locking glove box. The vehicle is not equipped with seat belts or side windows.",
      "The three-spoke steering wheel frames instrumentation sourced from a Pontiac Trans Am, including a 120-mph speedometer, a tachometer, and auxiliary gauges. The six-digit odometer shows 1k miles, and total chassis mileage is unknown.",
      "The fuel-injected 350ci V8 was installed during the build and features finned valve covers, a chrome alternator, and an exhaust system with dual glasspack mufflers. The fuel tank and fuel level sending unit were replaced in 2023, at which time the spark plugs, wires, and the distributor cap and rotor were also replaced.",
      "Power is delivered to the rear wheels via a five-speed manual transmission and a 4.10:1 rear end. Work in 2023 involved replacing the clutch assembly and machining the flywheel.",
      "The truck is titled using the Arizona Assigned Identification Number shown above. The Washington title lists “Antique” under the brands section."

The 235ci inline-six was subsequently serviced and started, according to the seller, and it is mated to a replacement three-speed manual transmission. A damaged black removable hardtop will accompany the car, and a worn black soft top remains along with bucket seats upholstered in black vinyl. This C1 Corvette is now offered as a running project with a clean Michigan title in the seller’s name.",
      "The fiberglass body wears worn and cracked red paint, which was applied at some point under prior ownership. The headlight covers are missing. The black soft top remains, but is worn and damaged. The included black hardtop has damage and wear, and the rear window is broken. A portion of the left-front fender has broken off the car, and the damaged corner piece will accompany the car.",
      "Steel 15” wheels wear polished covers with faux knock-off spinners and are mounted with a mixed set of worn and cracked tires. The C1 was equipped from the factory with an independent front suspension, front and rear hydraulic shocks, a live rear axle with semi-elliptical leaf springs, and four-wheel drum brakes. Condition of the braking system is unknown.",
      "The bucket seats are faired into the rear bodywork, and they are trimmed in black and complemented by a color-coordinated dash pad and door panels. The carpeting has been removed, the dashtop is cracked, and pitting and wear are noted on the dashboard trim and the AM radio.",
      "The worn and cracked two-spoke steering wheel frames a 140-mph speedometer. A central 5k-rpm tachometer is flanked by gauges for coolant temperature, oil pressure, amperage, and fuel level. The five-digit odometer shows 96k miles.",
      "The 235ci “Blue Flame” inline-six was factory equipped with three Carter YH side-draft carburetors and was converted to a single two-barrel setup under prior ownership. The seller states work was performed to get the engine started in preparation for the sale.",
      "Power is routed to the rear wheels via a three-speed manual transmission, which was installed in place of the automatic transmission under prior ownership. The dual exhaust system has been cut behind the mufflers."

      "This 2019 BMW R1250GS Adventure HP is finished in blue, white, and red, and it was purchased by the seller on BaT in April 2023. The bike is powered by a liquid-cooled 1,254cc DOHC opposed-twin that is mated to a six-speed gearbox, a quick-shifter, and an enclosed driveshaft. Optioned with a factory alarm and lowered suspension along with the Premium and Option 719 Billet packages, it is equipped with gold-anodized alloy rims, triple disc brakes, a Telelever front end, and a Paralever rear end as well as a clear windshield, two-piece seating, a TFT multifunction display, aluminum box-style panniers, an aluminum skid plate, and a stainless-steel rear rack. The factory ECU tune was restored under current ownership, and the odometer now indicates 5k miles. This R1250GS is offered with owner’s manuals, a copy of the dealer pricing sheet, a BMW GPS navigation unit, oil-change supplies, and a clean Texas title in the seller’s name.",
      "The bike is finished in Racing Blue Metallic, Light White, and N2E Racing Red and features a matte black cockpit trim panel as well as stepped, two-piece, and adjustable-height seating in black. Equipment includes a slipstream deflector, an adjustable clear windshield, LED auxiliary lights, an eight-gallon aluminum fuel tank, a polished stainless-steel rear rack, front protection bars, an aluminum skid plate, both center and side stands, and Motorrad aluminum-box panniers to which Xpel paint protection film has been applied. The Option 719 milled-parts package added silver-anodized aluminum components consisting of covers for the cylinder heads, ignition coil, front engine housing, and expansion tank as well as the hand levers, foot pegs, brake pedal, shift lever, oil-filler plug, and mirrors. There are scratches on the right-side engine guard, and most of the gallery photos and videos were shot in February 2024.",
      "Wire-spoke wheels with rim-edge spoking and gold-anodized alloy rims measure 19″ up front and 17″ at the rear, and they are wrapped in Bridgestone Battlax Adventure A41 dual sport tires. Optional factory-lowered suspension is provided by a Telelever fork with a hydraulic steering damper as well as an adjustable ZF monoshock mounted to a Paralever single-sided cast-aluminum swingarm. Braking is from dual 305mm front discs and a single 276mm rear disc.",
      "The black-finished double-butted alloy handlebar carries heated grips and white plastic hand guards. The 6.5″ TFT color display ahead shows a speedometer, a tachometer, and auxiliary information, and it has Bluetooth media and telephone connectivity. On-screen functions are managed through a multi-controller located inboard of the left hand grip. Additional features include Rain and Road modes, Hill Start Control, switchable ABS, and switchable Automatic Stability Control. The motorcycle was optioned with a factory alarm system, and a BMW Motorrad GPS navigation unit will accompany the motorcycle. The digital odometer indicates 5k miles, approximately 4k of which were ridden under current ownership. The service-due message has been showing since April 2024.",
      "The liquid-cooled 1,254cc DOHC opposed twin was factory rated at 136 horsepower and features ShiftCam variable valve timing, electronic throttle valve control, and a stainless-steel exhaust system. The battery was replaced in March 2023, the oil was most recently changed the following month, and a previously flashed ECU tune was replaced with the stock tune under current ownership.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheel via a hydraulically operated clutch, a six-speed gearbox, and an enclosed driveshaft, supplemented by the Dynamic package’s Gear Shift Assistant Pro quick-shifter.",
      "The copy of the BMW dealer pricing sheet lists initial delivery to BMW Motorcycles of Escondido in California, factory colors and equipment, and a total suggested retail price of $28,010."

      "This 1989 Chevrolet K1500 Silverado is a regular-cab Stepside pickup obtained new by a couple in September 1988 from Sexton Chevrolet-Cadillac in Harriman, Tennessee. The truck remained under the care of the original owners until it was acquired by their next-door neighbor and best friend in 2020. The current and third owner, a vehicle collector, purchased the truck in October 2021 and has added approximately 2k of the 16k miles shown. Work under their ownership involved replacing the exhaust system in May 2024. The truck features a Brandywine Metallic finish over Garnet cloth upholstery and is powered by a 5.7-liter V8 linked with a three-speed automatic transmission, a dual-range transfer case, and a locking rear differential. Equipment includes a receiver hitch and 16″ five-spoke alloy wheels along with a cassette stereo, cruise control, and air conditioning. This GMT400 pickup is now offered in Texas by the seller on behalf of the current owner with 1988 sales documentation, manufacturer’s literature, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Montana title in the owner’s name.",
      "The truck is finished in Brandywine Metallic with a Stepside bed. It also has a receiver hitch, a sliding rear window, and chrome bumpers. A ceramic coating was applied in 2024, and close-up photographs of the exterior finish and trim are shown in the gallery below.",

      "The 5.7-liter V8 was factory rated at 210 horsepower and 300 lb-ft of torque. Exhaust components were replaced in March 2024, and an oil change was performed in June 2024.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a three-speed automatic transmission, a dual-range transfer case, and a locking rear differential. The transmission fluid and differential fluids were changed in 2023.",

      "This 1965 Ford Mustang fastback was fitted with a 408ci stroker V8 and a Tremec five-speed manual transmission after the seller’s 2020 acquisition. Further equipment includes MSD ignition, a custom aluminum radiator, dual electric fans, underhood bracing, and long-tube headers that flow to a GT350-style side-exit exhaust system, and the car rides on a modified suspension with front coilovers, electric power steering, and a rear leaf spring setup. Black-finished 15″ wheels are mounted over Wilwood front disc brakes. The car wears a black vinyl wrap with an aftermarket hood that features a scoop and retainer pins, and the cabin is equipped with TMI front bucket seats, a Bluetooth stereo, a custom center console, and auxiliary instrumentation. This modified Mustang is now offered with service records and transferable New York registration in the seller’s name.",

An electric power steering system is installed, and stopping power is provided by front disc brakes and rear drums with Wilwood components.",
      "TMI front bucket seats are trimmed in black vinyl and separated by an aftermarket console with cupholders. Details include a floor shifter, a Bluetooth stereo, and a tilting steering column.",

      "The 351ci Windsor V8 is said to have been stroked to displace 408ci, and it is equipped with MSD ignition components, a custom aluminum radiator, dual electric fans, and chrome valve covers. The engine bay was refinished and fitted with an export brace and a Monte Carlo bar.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a T5 five-speed manual transmission with a hydraulic clutch kit. Long-tube headers flow to bullet-style mufflers and a GT350-style side-exit exhaust system.",
      "Photos taken during the build are provided in the gallery.",
      "The car does not have a title, as it is registered in a state that does not issue titles for a vehicle of its age. It is being sold on its transferable New York registration."

      "This 1986 Porsche 928S is finished in Guards Red over black leather and is powered by a 5.0-liter V8 paired with a five-speed manual transaxle. Equipment includes an aluminum radiator, 16″ seven-hole alloy wheels, a sunroof, a rear spoiler, pop-up headlights, power-adjustable front bucket seats, an Alpine CD stereo, cruise control, and air conditioning. The car was acquired by the seller in December 2022, and subsequent work is said to include replacing the timing belt and the water pump as well as various AC, fuel, and ignition components. This 928S shows 101k miles and it is now offered with the owner’s manual, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Texas title in the seller’s name.",
      "The car is finished in Guards Red (80K) and features a sunroof, a rear window wiper, a rear spoiler, fog lights, side moldings, and pop-up headlights with washers. The rear window wiper was reportedly repaired under current ownership. The power-adjusting feature of the side mirrors as well as the reversing lights do not work.",
      "The 16″ seven-hole alloy wheels are mounted with Michelin Pilot Sport All-Season 4 tires that are said to have been replaced in preparation for the sale. Braking is handled by power-assisted discs at each corner. The seller notes that the axle boots and brake hoses were replaced, a brake service performed, and a power steering leak repaired under current ownership.",
      "The cabin features power-adjustable front bucket seats and folding rear seats trimmed in black leather. The rear seats have been reupholstered and the rear cargo carpet replaced, per the seller. The front seats show signs of wear. Interior appointments include an Alpine CD stereo, aftermarket speakers, cruise control, and air conditioning. The passenger side window motor as well as a scuff plate have reportedly been replaced under current ownership.",
      "The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a 170-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 6k-rpm redline as well as auxiliary gauges for coolant temperature, fuel level, oil pressure, and voltage. The six-digit odometer shows 101k miles, approximately 1,200 of which were added under current ownership. The tachometer was repaired in June 2024.",
      "The 5.0-liter V8 was factory rated at 288 horsepower and 302 lb-ft of torque. An aluminum radiator has been installed. Work under current ownership is said to have included replacing the timing belt, water pump, spark plugs, ignition wires, the distributor cap and rotor, and various belts, hoses and lines. The AC compressor, drier, the fan motor, an oxygen sensor, the engine mounts, the hood latch cable, and the battery as well as the fuel pump, relay, the fuel filter, fuel lines, and injectors.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a rear-mounted five-speed manual transaxle.",
      "The Carfax report is free of accidents or other damage. There are multiple gaps in entries."

      "This Factory Five Racing Mk3 Roadster is a Shelby Cobra replica that was ordered as a kit by the seller in 2005 and subsequently assembled over a multi-year period completed in 2019. It is powered by a side-oiler V8 that has been modified to displace 482ci and mated to a Tremec TKO600 five-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential. Finished in Guardsman Blue with Wimbledon White stripes over black leather upholstery, the car is equipped with pin-drive 17″ wheels, disc brakes, independent suspension, Edelbrock aluminum cylinder heads, a Comp Cams hydraulic roller camshaft, dual Holley 660-cfm carburetors, MSD ignition, a wood-rimmed steering wheel, a keyed push-button ignition, and a fire extinguisher. Previously offered on BaT in May 2022, this Mk3 Roadster is offered again by the seller with Ontario registration describing the car as a 2005 F5R Kit.",
      "The seller reports that the body edges were rolled and the fender wells were extended before the fiberglass bodywork was finished in Guardsman Blue with Wimbledon White center stripes. Exterior details include polished bumperettes, a hood scoop, fender vents, wind wings, dual side-view mirrors, a single roll hoop, a Le Mans-style fuel filler, and dual side-exit exhaust outlets.",
      "Halibrand-style 17″ wheels are secured with three-eared pin-drive knockoffs and are mounted with BF Goodrich G-Force T/A tires that measure 245/45 up front and 315/35 out back. The car is equipped with four-wheel independent suspension and four-wheel disc brakes with Wilwood calipers, braided stainless hoses, remote fluid reservoirs, and a cockpit-mounted proportioning valve. The seller notes that the tires have less than 500 miles since installed but are approximately 20 years old.",
      "The fixed-back bucket seats are trimmed in black leather and are fitted with Simpson racing harnesses. Additional interior elements include a dashboard-mounted rearview mirror, Wilwood pedals, widened foot boxes, leather door check straps, a keyed push-button ignition, and a fire extinguisher. The seat heaters are inoperative.",
      "The wood-rimmed steering wheel fronts a black upholstered dashboard that houses AutoMeter instrumentation that includes a reverse-sweep 180-mph speedometer, a tachometer, and readouts for oil pressure, oil temperature, coolant temperature, voltage, and fuel level. The five-digit mechanical odometer shows 498 miles, which reflects the distance traveled since the car was assembled.",
      "The seller states that the 427ci V8 was bored and stroked to displace 482ci using a Bear Block Motors FE side-oiler block in addition to the following components:",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a Tremec TKO600 five-speed manual transmission reportedly equipped with a Lakewood bell housing and scatter shield, a Ram 11” clutch, and a Torsen limited-slip differential with an aluminum stiffening brace.",
      "The car is registered in Ontario as a 2005 F5R Kit using the chassis stamp F5R100511RD, shown above."

The car is equipped with a 4.2-liter inline-six, a four-speed manual transmission, a limited-slip differential, a black soft top and boot, enclosed headlights, 15″ wire-spoke steel wheels, power-assisted disc brakes, and a heater. This XKE Series I roadster was acquired by the current owner in 2024 and is now offered at no reserve on dealer consignment with a Jaguar Heritage Trust Certificate, removed parts, and a clean Oregon title.",

This example came finished from the factory in Pale Primrose, and additional equipment includes a black soft top, a soft top boot, enclosed headlights, a louvered clamshell hood, wraparound chrome bumpers, and dual exhaust outlets. Rust and paint flaking are present throughout the body.",

      "The 4.2-liter inline-six is linked with a four-speed manual gearbox and a limited-slip differential. Three SU carburetors are included in the sale. The engine is not in running condition, and it is unknown when the car was last driven.",
      "The cylinder head stamp reads 7E1616-9.",
      "Additional photos of the underbody are provided in the gallery.",

It is powered by a supercharged 4.6-liter V8 mated to a five-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential, and it is finished in Vista Blue Metallic with white stripes over black leather. Equipment includes 18″ chrome five-spoke wheels, xenon headlights, fog lights, Roush-specific bodywork, Roush graphics, a hood scoop, quarter-window louvers, a rear spoiler, a lowered suspension, Roush front seats, a short-throw shifter, a Shaker sound system, an in-dash six-disc CD changer, air conditioning, and cruise control. This Roush-modified S197 is now offered with Roush documentation, the owner’s manual, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Wisconsin title in the seller’s name.",
      "The bodywork is finished in Vista Blue Metallic (G9) with white racing stripes and Roush graphics, and exterior features include xenon headlights, fog lights, a hood scoop, power-operated side mirrors, and dual exhaust outlets. The Mustang bodywork was revised as part of the Roush conversion including the front fascia, rear wing, and chin spoiler, the latter of which shows imperfections.",
      "The Roush 18″ chrome five-spoke wheels are mounted with Cooper Zeon tires. Braking is handled by four-wheel discs. Handling components have been tuned by Roush, including a lowered suspension with revised front and rear springs and jounce bumpers.",
      "The Roush seats are trimmed in black and gray leather with embroidered Jack Roush signatures. Interior equipment includes a power-adjustable driver’s seat, a short-throw shifter, a spherical shift knob, Roush aluminum pedals and door sill plates, a Shaker sound system, an in-dash six-disc CD changer, air conditioning, and cruise control.",
      "The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames white Roush gauges including a 144-mph speedometer, an 8k-rpm tachometer, and auxiliary gauges. The digital odometer indicates 14k miles.",
      "The limited-production Roush 428R is differentiated from the 427R by its polished Roush supercharger assembly, which contributes to Roush-rated output of 435 horsepower and 400 lb-ft of torque for the 4.6-liter Modular V8, which also features a Roush intercooler, intake manifold, radiator, and exhaust system as well as a reprogrammed ECM. Fluids services were performed approximately two years ago.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a five-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential.",
      "The Roush 428R Certificate of Authenticity lists the VIN and indicates that the car is one of 200 examples converted to Roush 428R specification for the 2008 model year.",
      "The Carfax report shows no accidents or damage."

The seller has been the caretaker for the bike since a friend joined the Navy in 2015, and they purchased the bike in 2023. This CB1100 shows 13k miles and is offered with a tool kit, an owner’s manual, and a clean Michigan title in the seller’s name.",

      "Split-spoke 18″ alloy wheels are finished in black with polished lips and are mounted with Bridgestone Battlax tires. Adjustable suspension consists of a 41mm telescopic fork as well as dual preload-adjustable shocks mounted to the swingarm. Braking is handled by dual four-piston Nissin calipers over 296mm cross-drilled discs up front and a single-piston caliper over a 256mm cross-drilled disc in the rear.",

The digital odometer indicates 13k miles, approximately 300 of which were ridden by the seller. The handlebar is bent near the right grip, and the bar-end weight is scratched.",
      "The air-cooled 1,140cc DOHC inline-four was factory rated at 89 horsepower and features electronic fuel injection with quad 32mm throttle bodies as well as four valves per cylinder, an electric starter, and a four-into-one exhaust system with an upswept chrome muffler. The most recent oil change was performed in 2020. Scratches and oxidation are visible on the polished engine covers, and the exhaust system has scuffs and dings.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheel through a multi-plate wet clutch, a five-speed transmission, and a drive chain with a black upper guard.",
      "The current Michigan title has been signed."

The digital odometer indicates 31k miles, approximately 2k of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The mid-mounted 3.6-liter Tipo F131 V8 features a flat-plane crankshaft, dry-sump lubrication, dual overhead camshafts, and five valves per cylinder. Factory-rated output was 395 horsepower and 275 lb-ft of torque. A timing belt service was performed in April 2024, at which time the heat exchanger was replaced.",

      "This 2005 Dodge Viper SRT-10 roadster spent time in New York before being brought to Ontario, Canada, in 2009 where the seller purchased it in August of that year. Finished in Viper Red over black leather and microsuede, the car is powered by an 8.3-liter V10 paired with a six-speed manual transmission. Modifications include an aftermarket exhaust system, a rear decklid spoiler, Strasse 19″ and 20″ wheels, rear diffuser fins, and an aftermarket CD stereo with a navigation screen. Retained factory equipment includes a limited-slip differential, a black convertible soft top, HID headlights, dual roll hoops, and air conditioning. This Viper SRT-10 roadster is now offered in Canada with an accident-free US Carfax report and Ontario registration in the seller’s name.",
      "The car is finished in Viper Red and features a black convertible soft top, a rear decklid spoiler, HID headlights, fog lights, a hood scoop, power mirrors, side-exit exhaust outlets, and rear diffuser fins. The seller notes stone chips behind the front wheels.",
      "The 19″ front and 20″ rear Strasse wheels are finished in black with red lips and are mounted with Pirelli P Zero tires measuring 285/30 up front and 345/25 out back. Stopping power is handled by Viper-branded calipers over disc brakes at each corner. The Carfax report notes that the power steering pump and steering gear were replaced in July 2024.",
      "The cockpit features bolstered seats upholstered in black leather with microsuede inserts and Viper scripts embroidered on the backrests. Interior amenities include air conditioning, push-button start, dual roll hoops, power windows, metal pedals, and an aftermarket CD stereo with a navigation screen.",
      "The three-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a 220-mph speedometer, a central tachometer, and a fuel-level gauge. The center stack is equipped with gauges for oil pressure, oil temperature, coolant temperature, and voltage. The digital odometer indicates under 20k miles, approximately 13k of which the seller reports adding. The Carfax report notes mileage inconsistencies in September 2012 and May 2013, and total mileage is unknown.",
      "The 8.3-liter V10 was factory rated at 500 horsepower and 525 lb-ft of torque. An aftermarket exhaust system is installed.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a Tremec six-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential. The clutch components were reportedly replaced in 2013.",
      "The US Carfax report notes the aforementioned mileage inconsistencies and at least one recall.",
      "The vehicle does not have a title and is being sold on its Ontario registration, which serves as the ownership document in Ontario, Canada."

      "Steel 8″ three-spoke wheels are finished in black and are wrapped with older, cracked Bridgestone tires. Braking is from drums at both ends. Suspension consists of a leading-axle telescopic fork as well as a monoshock connected to the drive unit, which doubles as the swingarm.",
      "Instrumentation consists of a handlebar-mounted 50-km/h speedometer and an oil indicator light as well as a fuel-level gauge located atop the fuel tank. No odometer was equipped from the factory, therefore total mileage is unknown.",
      "The air-cooled 49cc two-stroke single is mounted horizontally and was factory rated at 2.5 horsepower and 2.75 lb-ft of torque. Features include oil injection, a kick starter, and an exhaust system that is tucked beneath the rear bodywork.

The handlebars, seat, and foot pegs fold flat, and the body features a master fuel switch as well as integrated lift handles and tie-down points to facilitate transport. The bike weighs 99 pounds with fluids, per period sales literature.",

      "This 1976 Ford Bronco was acquired by the seller in 2015 and subsequent work consisted of re-wiring the truck, replacing the hood, repainting the body in blue, refreshing the removable hardtop, and installing tires and a quick removal system for the doors. Power is provided by a 302ci V8 linked with a three-speed automatic transmission and a dual-range transfer case, and modifications include a body lift kit, a six-point roll cage, a receiver hitch, 15″ M/T alloy wheels, cut fenders, and black fender extensions. The truck is further equipped with power steering, power front disc brakes, an aluminum radiator, an HEI distributor, and exhaust headers, and the cabin is outfitted with Parchment vinyl upholstery, a center console, front bucket seats, and a cabin heater. This Bronco is now offered with a Georgia registration in the seller’s name.",
      "The truck was repainted in blue under current ownership and the hood was replaced. Details include a white removable hardtop, a body-color grille, an aftermarket rear bumper, a receiver hitch, and a painted front bumper. The truck has been modified with cut fenders and black fender extensions, and a replacement hood and a quick removal system for the doors has been fitted. There are dents and dings in the body.",
      "The 15″ M/T alloy wheels are mounted with 33×12.50″ Cooper Discoverer AT3 tires that were installed recently. The truck is equipped with manually locking front hubs, body and suspension lifts, and power steering. Braking is handled by power-assisted front discs and rear drums. The brakes and shocks are said to have been replaced since 2015.",
      "The front bucket seats and rear bench are trimmed in Parchment vinyl, and amenities include a center console, door armrests, and a cabin heater. The truck was reportedly re-wired, the rollbar and shoulder belts were fitted under current ownership. A rubberized coating is applied to the floors.",
      "Instrumentation includes a 100-mph speedometer and auxiliary gauges for amperage, fuel level, coolant temperature, and oil pressure. The five-digit odometer shows 52k miles, approximately 10k of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The 302ci V8 has been fitted with a four-barrel carburetor, an HEI-style distributor, a Champion aluminum radiator, and exhaust headers. Power is routed to the rear or all four wheels via a three-speed automatic transmission and a dual-range transfer case. An aftermarket dual exhaust system has been fitted. Corrosion is noted on underbody components.",
      "The truck does not have a title, as it is registered in a state that does not issue titles for a vehicle of its age. It is being sold on its Georgia registration."

      "This 1967 Chevrolet C10 pickup now shows 41k miles after the seller’s acquisition in May 2024. It features a finish in light green with white bumpers over green vinyl upholstery, and work under prior ownership is said to have included repainting the doors, fenders, and tailgate as well as replacing braking, suspension, and exhaust components. Power is provided by a 250ci inline-six linked with a four-speed manual transmission. Equipment includes 15″ steel wheels, power-assisted disc brakes, a bed-mounted spare tire, a heater, and wind-up windows. This C10 is offered with a clean California title in the seller’s name.",
      "The truck is finished in light green, and the doors, fenders, and tailgate were repainted under prior ownership. Equipment includes white bumpers, a bed-mounted spare tire, and dual side mirrors. Close-up images of exterior blemishes are provided in the gallery.",
      "Black-painted 15″ steel wheels wear bowtie-logo hubcaps and are mounted with narrow-whitewall tires. Braking is provided by power-assisted drum brakes at each corner. The seller states the brake booster and shocks were replaced under current ownership.",
      "The bench seat is trimmed in green vinyl said to be original to the truck, and appointments include a heater, wind-up windows, and lap belts.",
      "The three-spoke steering wheel frames a 100-mph speedometer and a fuel-level gauge. The five-digit odometer shows 41k miles, less than 100 of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The 250ci inline-six was factory rated at 125 horsepower and 220 lb-ft of torque. Exhaust components were replaced under prior ownership. An oil leak is noted.",
      "Power is routed to the rear wheels through a four-speed manual transmission."

      "This 1973 Triumph TR6 was acquired by the seller in 2011 following a repaint in blue and an interior refurbishment in tan. A 2.5-liter inline-six with triple Weber sidedraft carburetors and a higher-compression cylinder head sends power to the rear wheels through a four-speed manual transmission. Equipment includes a black convertible top, 15″ steel wheels with polished rings, a chrome luggage rack, a stainless-steel dual exhaust system, a cassette stereo, and a heater. The windshield and clutch components were replaced in 2024, and the flywheel was resurfaced. This TR6 is now offered in Canada with a top boot, service records, and Alberta registration.",
      "The car was refinished in blue under previous ownership and features a black convertible top with reflective stripes as well as a top boot, a chrome luggage rack, a plastic air dam, Union Jack decals, and dual side mirrors. The windshield was replaced in preparation for the sale. The seller notes areas of poor paint around the car. Chips and touched-up blemishes are visible, and the antenna is broken off.",
      "Silver-finished 15″ steel wheels wear polished trim rings and 205/70 Yokohama Avid tires. Stopping power is provided by front disc and rear drum brakes.",
      "The cabin features earlier-style bucket seats reupholstered in tan vinyl with patterned cloth inserts. Interior appointments include a cassette stereo, a locking glovebox, and a heater.",
      "The three-spoke steering wheel fronts a 140-mph speedometer and a tachometer while gauges for oil pressure, coolant temperature, voltage, and fuel level are mounted in the center of the dashboard. The five-digit odometer shows 23k miles, approximately 12k of which were added under current ownership. Total mileage is unknown.",
      "The 2.5-liter inline-six features triple Weber sidedraft carburetors, an electric puller fan, a stainless-steel dual exhaust system, and a recurved distributor with no vacuum advance or retard provisions. The cylinder head was reportedly rebuilt in 2016 with larger exhaust valves and a shaved surface. Compression test results are presented in the gallery.",
      "Power is routed to the rear wheels through a four-speed manual transmission. Work in 2024 consisted of resurfacing the flywheel, installing a new clutch release cross-shaft, bearing, fork and taper pin, and replacing the clutch disc and pressure plate.",
      "The vehicle is being sold on its Alberta registration, which serves as the ownership document in Alberta, Canada. It does not have a title."

      "This 1975 Honda CB400F Super Sport spent time in California before it was acquired by the seller in 2011, reportedly from its second owner. A subsequent refurbishment is said to have included refinishing the bodywork in red, re-plating the four-into-one exhaust system, chain guard, and front fender, and powder-coating the frame as well as replacing the speedometer, headlight bucket, seat cover, muffler, right-side hand controls, engine gaskets, clutch plates, ignition wires, spark plugs, brake pads and shoes, and tires. Power is provided by a 408cc SOHC inline-four paired with a six-speed transmission, and equipment includes an electric starter, a kick starter, a quartet of Keihin carburetors, a front disc brake, wire-spoke wheels, and both center and side stands. This CB400F is offered at no reserve with a period helmet, a factory service manual, a reproduction owner’s manual, a tool kit, dealer promotional materials, refurbishment photos, and a clean California title in the seller’s name.",
      "The bike was disassembled circa 2011, at which time the frame was powder-coated in black and the bodywork was refinished in red with blue and gold script. The two-up seat was fitted with a replacement black vinyl cover as part of the refurbishment, and additional features include chrome-finished fenders, aftermarket turn signals, and both center and side stands. The chrome plating on the front fender is uneven, and blemishes are identified by the seller in the gallery below. The bike is not currently equipped with mirrors, and the seller notes that the left-side mirror glass is missing.",
      "Wire-spoke 18″ wheels were mounted with Duro tires under current ownership. Suspension consists of a conventional fork in addition to dual shocks mounted to the swingarm, and braking is handled by a front disc and a rear drum. The seller states that the front brake pads and the rear brake shoes were changed as part of the refurbishment. Photos show pitting, missing chrome plating, and corrosion on the wheels.",
      "The chrome-finished handlebar sits aft of a replacement headlight bucket and was fitted with replacement right-side hand controls. Instrumentation consists of a replacement 130-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a faded 8,200-rpm redline. The five-digit odometer shows 726 miles. Total mileage is unknown.",
      "The air-cooled 408cc SOHC inline-four is equipped with both kick and electric starters, and it produced 37 horsepower when new. Work performed as part of the refurbishment is said to have included re-plating the four-into-one exhaust header pipes, installing an aftermarket muffler, and replacing the spark plugs, ignition wires, and various gaskets. The seller notes that the timing chain tensioner adjustment bolt is sheared.",
      "Power is routed to the rear wheel through a six-speed transmission and a drive chain. The seller reports that replacement clutch plates were installed as part of the refurbishment.",
      "A factory service manual is included in the sale along with a period open-face helmet, a tool kit, a reproduction owner’s manual, a brochure, and a dealership promotional poster.",
      "Photos illustrating various stages of the refurbishment can be viewed in the gallery below."

      "This 1970 Chevrolet K10 Custom is a fleetside pickup that was refurbished and modified under prior ownership before being acquired by the selling dealer in 2024. Power is provided by a replacement 350ci V8 linked with a three-speed automatic transmission, a dual-range transfer case, and a Positraction rear differential, and it was refinished in green and white with faux wood bodyside trim. The truck rides on a lifted suspension with Fox Performance shock absorbers, and 15″ Rally wheels are fitted over power-assisted front disc and rear drum brakes. On the inside, the bench seat is upholstered in black vinyl and accompanied by Vintage Air climate control, a retro-style push-button radio, and aftermarket audio speakers. Further equipment includes Mile Marker manually locking front hubs, an Edelbrock carburetor, and short-tube exhaust headers. This modified K10 is now offered in Maryland by the seller, a retail dealer in Virginia, with an owner’s manual and a clean Oklahoma title.",
      "Finished from the factory in Medium Olive and White, the truck was repainted and the glass was reportedly replaced in 2022 as part of the aforementioned refurbishment. A later-model grille was retrofitted, and additional details include a fleetside bed, faux wood trim, a sliding rear window, dual side mirrors, side steps, and chrome bumpers.",
      "The 15″ Rally wheels are mounted with 33×12.5″ ProComp Xterrain tires. The truck rides on a lifted suspension that features Fox Performance shock absorbers and is further equipped with power steering and Mile Marker manually locking front hubs. Braking is provided by power-assisted front discs and rear drums.",
      "The bench seat was reupholstered in black vinyl with patterned inserts, while the exposed metal surfaces were finished in green. Rubberized mats line the floorboards, and appointments include Vintage Air climate control, retractable lap belts, and a retro-style digital radio connected to speakers mounted in the kick panels.",
      "The two-spoke steering wheel is mounted to a tilt column and frames a centrally mounted tachometer as well as a 100-mph speedometer and auxiliary gauges for fuel level, voltage, coolant temperature, and oil pressure. The five-digit odometer shows 56k miles, approximately 120 of which have been added by the selling dealer. Total mileage is unknown.",
      "The replacement 350ci V8 was installed under prior ownership and is equipped with an Edelbrock AVS2 carburetor, short-tube headers, and a Chevrolet-branded air cleaner housing and valve covers.",
      "Power is routed to all four wheels through a three-speed Turbo Hydramatic automatic transmission, a dual-range transfer case, and a Positraction rear differential. A dual exhaust system has been fitted, and the transmission and transfer case were reportedly rebuilt as part of the refurbishment.",
      "The service parts identification decal lists factory colors and equipment."

    "description": [
      "This 1981 Yamaha RD350LC is said to have spent time on Vancouver Island before the seller’s acquisition in 2000. Finished in white with blue graphics, the bike is powered by a liquid-cooled 347cc two-stroke parallel twin paired with a six-speed transmission. Equipment includes Autolube oil injection, dual carburetors, a dual exhaust system, a kick starter, dual front disc brakes, 18″ alloy wheels, street lighting, and a two-up seat. Work since 2020 included changing the transmission fluid, coating the inside of the fuel tank, cleaning the carburetors, and replacing the clutch and tires. This RD350LC is offered at no reserve with spare parts, a workshop manual, service invoices, and a British Columbia registration in the seller’s name.",
      "The bike was purchased in 2000 by the seller, who believes that it was imported from Japan to Vancouver Island, Canada under previous ownership. The bike is finished in white with two-tone blue graphics over a black double-cradle steel frame. Details include street lighting, a black two-up seat, folding passenger foot pegs, and both center and side stands. The inside of the fuel tank was coated in 2021, and cosmetic bodywork was carried out before refinishing the fenders and side covers. The tank was coated in POR15 before refinishing. Blemishes in the paint are noted around the bike, and the removed rear grab bar is included in the sale.",
      "Cast-alloy 18″ wheels were mounted with Bridgestone tires in 2021. Suspension consists of a conventional telescopic fork and a monoshock mounted to the swingarm. Braking is handled by dual discs up front and a drum at the rear.",
      "The black low-rise handlebar carries dual mirrors and is mounted aft of a column of indicator lights flanked by a 200-km/h speedometer and a tachometer with a 9,500-rpm redline. The five-digit odometer shows 49k kilometers (~30k miles), approximately 1,700 kilometers of which were ridden under current ownership.",
      "The liquid-cooled 347cc two-stroke parallel twin features Autolube oil injection, a kick starter, and a two-into-two exhaust system. The carburetors were cleaned in preparation for the sale."

    "description": [
      "This 1966 Plymouth Barracuda was modified in the style of a “gasser” drag racer around 2008, when the car was mounted on a rotisserie, stripped, and refinished and then a replacement overbored 440ci V8 and a four-speed manual transmission were installed. The rear end was tubbed to accommodate 31×18.50″ tires on 15″ Weld Racing wheels, and 26×7.50″ tires, 15″ Jegs wheels, and a straight axle are fitted at the front of the vehicle. Other equipment includes an 8¾” rear end, Moser axles, Richmond 4.10:1 gears, power-assisted Wilwood four-wheel disc brakes, power steering, a wheelie bar, a fuel cell, a cutout-equipped dual exhaust system, an 850-cfm carburetor, a Weiand intake manifold, and aftermarket gauges plus a black-upholstered interior. The current owner acquired the car in 2019. This modified Barracuda—nicknamed “The Gasser Passer”—is now offered in Delaware on dealer consignment with build records and photos as well as a clean Florida title.",
      "The car was stripped and refinished in a shade of metallic red based on a Ford color during the aforementioned refurbishment. A Hemi badge is attached to the grille, and other features include headlamps, taillights, chrome bumpers, bright trim, a hood scoop, a driver-side mirror, tinted glass, and a curved rear window. The car lacks windshield wipers and a wiper motor. Chips and scratches in the paint and other imperfections are pictured in the gallery below.",
      "Bright-finished Jegs 15″ front and Weld Racing 15″ rear wheels are mounted with Mickey Thompson Sportsman M/T tires that measure 26×7.50″ at the front and 31×18.50″ out back. A Wilwood braking system utilizes discs at all four corners and a custom power booster. The front axle has been converted to a straight-axle setup with power steering and leaf springs, and leaf springs and coilovers help locate the live rear axle, which is positioned just ahead of a dual wheelie bar.",
      "The front bucket and rear bench seats are upholstered in black vinyl, which is complemented by black door and side panels, black carpeting, and a black headliner. Wood trim adorns the dashboard, and diamond-plate material is used on the sill covers and kick plates. Other appointments include front lap belts, a Hurst shifter, and a fire extinguisher. An array of switches on the dash operate lights, the fuel pump, and the car’s main power. The vehicle does not have a heater.",
      "A woodgrain-style steering wheel fronts a padded dash top that anchors a Sunpro Supertach II tachometer, and a quintet of Stewart-Warner gauges monitors vehicle speed, water temperature, fuel level, oil pressure, and voltage. The digital odometer is not connected, and true chassis mileage is unknown.",
      "The trunk compartment houses a 15-gallon fuel cell and the vehicle’s battery.",
      "The 440ci V8 is said to have been sourced from a 1970s Dodge truck and was bored .030″ over during the refurbishment for a total displacement of 446ci. Equipment is said to include Keith Black pistons, a Lunati Voodoo camshaft, Crane Cams roller rocker arms, ProComp ignition components, a Weiand aluminum intake manifold, an 850-cfm double-pumper carburetor, oversize valves, heavy-duty valve springs, chrome valve covers, Doug Thorley Headers, and a three-row aluminum radiator with an auxiliary electric fan. The car’s chassis number indicates that it was originally powered by a 273ci V8.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a rebuilt four-speed manual transmission said to have been sourced from a 1970 Plymouth ’Cuda and augmented by a lightweight flywheel, an 11″ clutch, and Hurst linkage as well as a narrowed “742” Chrysler 8¾” rear end, Moser axles, and Richmond 4.10:1 gears. The underside has been strengthened, in part by a driveshaft loop and reinforced frame rails. The dual exhaust system has electrically actuated cutouts that dump just behind the front wheels, and the system continues through dual mufflers and terminates ahead of the rear wheels. Corrosion is visible on underbody components.",
      "Folders containing service and build records as well as images documenting the refurbishment will accompany the car and are shown in the photo gallery."

It is powered by a twin-turbocharged 3.0L flat-six that drives all four wheels through a seven-speed PDK dual-clutch transaxle and is finished in Carrara White Metallic over Espresso and Cognac Natural leather. The car is further equipped with 20″ Carrera Classic alloy wheels, a red convertible soft top, LED headlights with PDLS+, a back-up camera, a Burmester sound system, mahogany interior trim, Lane Change Assist, and heated and ventilated power-adjustable front sport seats. Acquired by the selling dealer in 2024, this 991.2 C4S cabriolet is now offered with the owner’s manual, two keys, a clean Carfax report, and a clean New York title.",

Braking is handled by red-painted Porsche-branded calipers over cross-drilled and ventilated discs, and the car is equipped with Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM). The brake fluid was flushed in July 2023.",

The optional Sport Chrono Package added a stopwatch atop the dashboard. The digital odometer indicates 9k miles.",

      "This 1954 Chevrolet 3100 five-window pickup was modified around 2010. Riding on a boxed frame with a Plymouth Volare-sourced front end, the truck is powered by a 383ci ZZ V8 linked to a 700R4 automatic transmission and a Ford 9″ rear end with 3.70 gears. The exterior was refinished with red paintwork, a mahogany bed, and chrome trim, and Cragar SS wheels were installed along with 11″ front disc brakes, an Ididit column, Vintage Air climate control, power windows, and an Alpine stereo. This 3100 pickup was acquired by the current owner in 2011 and is now offered at no reserve on dealer consignment with records and an Arizona title.",
      "The rear fenders, box, running boards, and floorboards were replaced before the truck was repainted by Color Works Auto Refinishing in Denver, Colorado. The headlights, chrome front bumper, weather seals, and glass were replaced, and the rear bumper is a customized 1978 El Camino component that was narrowed and re-chromed.",
      "The tailgate has bowtie pinstriping and hidden latches and cables. The mahogany bed is separated by chrome strips and has a flush fuel filler for the stainless-steel fuel tank. A battery jump post is located under the right-side running board, and there is a battery disconnect behind the right seat.",
      "The front end was sourced from a Plymouth Volare, the frame was boxed, and Chassis Engineering rear springs were installed along with Bilstein shocks, power steering, 11″ front disc brakes, and stainless-steel lines. The 15″ Cragar wheels wear BFGoodrich Radial T/A tires.",
      "The bucket seats have inner armrests, and the custom console with an emergency brake and Alpine stereo are mounted between them. Vintage Air climate control, custom carpeting, and power windows were added.",
      "The Lecarra steering wheel is mounted on an Ididit column that has been painted to match the dashboard. The 27k miles on the replacement odometer represents the mileage driven since completion, with approximately 11k miles added by the current owner.",
      "The 383ci ZZ V8 is topped by a polished-aluminum intake manifold and a Holley carburetor. The exhaust manifolds have been powder-coated and are linked to a dual exhaust system with Flowmaster mufflers. A Zoops front-runner serpentine kit, an Afco aluminum radiator, a Haywire wiring harness, and chrome accessories have been installed. The spark plugs and valve cover gaskets were replaced in 2023.",
      "The 700R4 automatic transmission is linked to a Ford 9″ rear end with 3.70 gears that was installed in 2020. The truck also has a transmission cooler.",
      "A build summary and records in the gallery are included in the sale.",
      "The Arizona title carries a Not Actual Mileage odometer code."

The car was built around a 2017 Ford Mustang FP350S caged body and is powered by a 5.2-liter DOHC V8 linked to a Tremec six-speed manual transmission. The bodywork is finished in white with racing livery and a carbon-fiber roof and hood. Features include a carbon-fiber front splitter, a Verus rear diffuser, a Xineering Downshift Blip Module, an AIM Solo DL datalogger, a QA1 carbon-fiber driveshaft, and AP Racing calipers. The race-prepped cabin features an MSA-spec roll cage, a window net, a fire suppression system, a Sparco quick-release steering wheel, and a Momo seat with a Schroth Racing six-point harness. This Mustang race car is now offered in Michigan for off-road use only with a spare set of wheels and a bill of sale.",
      "The bodywork is finished in white with racing livery, and features include a custom side-exit exhaust, an Anderson carbon-fiber hood, an Anderson carbon-fiber roof, a front splitter, and a Verus rear diffuser. The seller notes that a door, a fender, and rear facia were damaged and have been replaced.",
      "Forgeline 18″ GS1R monoblock aluminum wheels with I-beam spokes are finished in pearl gray and wear Hoosier rain tires, while a matching set of wheels are mounted with Hoosier R7 tires. Stopping power comes from AP Racing’s six-piston Endurance front and four-piston rear calipers over two-piece vented and slotted rotors measuring 372mm and 340mm, respectively. The suspension utilizes JRi shocks with custom valving at all four corners.",
      "The cabin features a black Momo racing seat with a Schroth Racing six-point harness as well as a fire suppression system and a roll cage.",
      "The three-spoke Sparco quick-release steering wheel fronts a 200-mph speedometer, a tachometer with an 8,250-rpm redline, and an AIM Solo DL datalogger. Toggle-switch and push-button controls are housed in the center stack. The seller notes that a used gauge cluster was installed and set to 10k miles when the car was built. The odometer now reads 17k miles.",
      "The 5.2-liter DOHC V8 was recently rebuilt and features a billet oil pump, Watson Racing motor mounts, a Braille lithium battery, and an ATL fuel cell. Receipts for the engine work can be viewed in the photo gallery below.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a Tremec 3160 six-speed manual transmission, a QA1 carbon-fiber driveshaft with a heat shield, and a 3.55 rear differential."

      "This 1986 Suzuki RG500 Gamma was acquired new by the seller who has ridden it approximately 18k kilometers (~11k miles). It has been modified with a Lance Gamma clutch, a Fox shock with a ride-height adjuster, carbon valves, and a shift shaft support, and it has been repainted in white with blue with red graphics and is powered by a 498cc two-stroke square-four paired with a six-speed transmission. Additional equipment includes an aluminum twin-spar frame, a four-into-four expansion -chamber exhaust system, triple disc brakes, Enkei wheels, clip-on handlebars, and rear-set foot controls. This RG500 is now offered in Canada with spare parts, an owner’s manual, a bike cover, and an Ontario registration in the seller’s name.",
      "The fully-faired bodywork was refinished in white, and the blue and red graphics were replaced before the bodywork was clear-coated. A number of components have been powder-coated. Details include a rectangular headlight, NACA ducts, a 5.8-gallon fuel tank, a removable rear cowl, a side stand, rear-set foot controls, and fairing-mounted mirrors and indicators. The lower nose cone has a crack.",
      "Black-finished Enkei six-spoke wheels measuring 16″ up front and 17″ out back are mounted with Metzeler tires. Braking is handled by dual discs with four-piston calipers up front as well as a single disc with a twin-piston caliper out back. Suspension consists of a refurbished telescopic fork with an anti-dive function as well as a Fox monoshock and a ride-height adjuster mounted to the boxed aluminum swingarm.",
      "Clip-on handlebars are mounted below the top triple clamp and frame a 260-km/h speedometer, a tachometer with a 10k-rpm redline, and a coolant temperature gauge as well as a bank of indicator lights. The five-digit odometer shows 18k kilometers (~11k miles), all of which have been ridden by the seller.",
      "The liquid-cooled 498cc two-stroke square-four factory-rated output was 95 horsepower and it features a kick starter, carbon rotary disc valves, and two crankshafts geared to a central pilot shaft as well as a four-into-four expansion-chamber exhaust system that features Suzuki’s Automatic Exhaust Control (SAEC) system and two under-tail outlets. The exhaust system has been ceramic-coated, and the spark plugs and battery were replaced in 2023.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheel through a Lance Gamma wet clutch, a six-speed transmission, and a drive chain. The transmission oil was changed in 2023."

The car is finished in Baikal Metallic over blue cloth and is powered by a 3.0-liter M30 inline-six linked with a four-speed manual transmission. Equipment includes a sliding steel sunroof, 14″ light metal wheels, power-operated windows, a cassette stereo, and a heater. This E9 is now offered as a non-running project in Canada at no reserve with the owner’s manual, service records, spare parts, and British Columbia registration in the names of the seller and their sister.",
      "The car came finished from the factory in Baikal Metallic (42) and was repainted in the early 1980s, at which time rust remediation was performed on the firewall, front shock towers and fenders, and right front floor. Exterior features include a sliding steel sunroof, dual side mirrors, bright window trim, and chrome-finished bumpers with rubber impact strips. A replacement windshield and a right mirror were installed in the mid-1980s. The antenna is missing and the seller notes prior accident damage behind the front bumper. Rust is visible around the fenders, rear quarter panels, passenger-side rocker panel, trunk lid, and lower doors.",
      "The 14″ light metal wheels are mounted with older 205/70 BFGoodrich Comp T/A tires up front and 195/70 Toyo Radial Snow & Rally tires out back. Stopping power is provided by discs at all four corners.",
      "The cabin houses front bucket seats and contoured rear seats trimmed in blue cloth with vinyl sides and backs. Interior appointments include front seat head restraints, a Concord cassette stereo, power-operated windows, a heated rear window, Coco floor mats, a Momo shift knob, and a heater. There are tears on the driver’s seat and door panels, an area of the stereo housing has broken off, the passenger vent window does not close all the way, and the lower right corner of the windshield is delaminating.",
      "The three-spoke steering wheel fronts a 150-mph speedometer, a tachometer, an analog clock, and gauges for fuel level and coolant temperature. The five-digit odometer shows 85k miles, approximately 3,200 of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The 3.0-liter M30 inline-six was fitted with a replacement cylinder head in 1984 and is linked with a four-speed manual transmission. The car was last driven in 1990 and no longer runs.",
      "Additional underbody photos are provided in the gallery.",
      "The vehicle does not have a title and is being sold on its British Columbia registration, which serves as the ownership document in British Columbia, Canada."

Additional details include a powered sunroof, sliding rear windows, tubular side steps, and a rear window wiper. The Carfax report lists accidents reported in December 2003, January 2005, and September 2013 that resulted in damage to the front and right side of the vehicle. Scuffs are present on the right side of the front bumper, bubbling paint is noted below the rear glass, scratches are shown on the rear bumper, and there are scrapes and a dent on the left-rear door. Additional photos of fading paint on the roof and exterior imperfections are viewable in the gallery below.",

Details include two entry doors with porthole windows, boarding steps, LED taillights, and hinged windows. The coating on the roof is perforated and has deteriorated, and the seller notes dents in the trim and bodywork.",

      "This 1974 Volkswagen Thing is powered by an air-cooled 2,007cc flat-four that utilizes an aftermarket engine case modified for a full-flow oiling system and fitted with a 78mm crankshaft, 90.5 mm pistons and cylinders, an Engle camshaft, dual Weber carburetors, a Bosch 009 points-type distributor, high-flow heater boxes, and a modified A-1 Sidewinder exhaust system. It was acquired by the current owner out of Oregon and brought to California where it received over $40k in service before spending approximately a year in Hawaii. Additional details include 15″ aftermarket steel wheels, BFGoodrich All-Terrain tires, drum brakes, a four-speed manual transaxle, a chromoly lightweight flywheel, a 1700-lb pressure plate, and a 200mm clutch disc in addition to a hood rack, running boards, a receiver hitch, a fold-down windshield, removable doors, perforated rubber floor mats, duckboards, a Custom AutoSound head unit, and Memphis Audio speakers. This Type 181 is now offered on behalf of the current owner at no reserve in California with service records and a clean Hawaii title.",
      "The body is finished in beige with a black convertible soft top and removable side curtains. Exterior details include a hood rack, running boards, and a receiver hitch in addition to a fold-down windshield, fender-mounted turn signals, and removable doors. The tires rub the front fenders under hard braking.",
      "Aftermarket 15″ steel wheels have been powder-coated black and are mounted with 215/75 BFGoodrich All-Terrain T/A KO2 tires. The brake drums were machined and the master cylinder, wheel cylinders, hoses, shoes, and wheel bearings were replaced in February 2023.",
      "The front bucket seats and folding rear seats are trimmed in black vinyl upholstery. Interior elements include perforated rubber floor mats, duckboards, lap belts, and cupholders mounted to the ashtray receptacle. The audio system is reported to consist of a Custom AutoSound head unit linked to Memphis Audio speakers.",
      "The four-spoke steering wheel has been wrapped in leather and frames a 100-mph speedometer with an inset fuel-level gauge, while readouts for oil pressure and temperature are housed in a custom-fabricated pod in the center of the dashboard. The five-digit mechanical odometer shows 54k miles, approximately 1k of which have been added under current ownership.",
      "The air-cooled 2007cc flat-four was built by Wolfgang International in November 2021 using a replacement aftermarket magnesium engine case modified for a full-flow oiling system and clearanced for a 78mm stroker crankshaft. Additional engine details include 90.5mm pistons and cylinders, EMPI GTV-2 40×35.5 cylinder heads, an Engle W110 camshaft, a Bosch 009 points-type distributor, and dual Weber 40 IDF carburetors. In February 2023 the engine was removed and steam cleaned, the tins were powder-coated, the carburetor linkage was modified, and the oil cooler was replaced. Additional work performed at that time included installing a battery tender and adjusting the valves. Photos of engine compression readings are displayed in the gallery.",
      "Power is delivered to the rear wheels through a four-speed manual transaxle with a chromoly lightweight flywheel, a 1700-lb pressure plate, and a 200mm clutch disc. The gear oil was replaced in February 2023 along with the installation of high-flow heater boxes and modification of the A-1 Sidewinder exhaust system."

Finished in Midnight Blue Metallic over Cobalt leather and patterned cloth upholstery, the car is powered by a turbocharged 3.6-liter flat-six mated to a five-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. It rides on polished 18″ Speedline wheels and is further equipped with an electric sliding roof, a rear spoiler, heated and power-adjustable front seats, Dark Rootwood interior trim, and a factory cassette stereo. This 911 Turbo S Flachbau is now offered by the selling dealer in New York State with a Porsche Certificate of Authenticity and a rebuilt Indiana title.",

This example left the factory finished in Midnight Blue Metallic (F8) and is equipped with an electric sliding sunroof, a rear window wiper, and a body-colored rear spoiler. The Carfax report notes a salvage title issued in 2002, a total loss damage report in 2009, and severe damage reported in 2013. According to the seller, the aforementioned reports are related to a collision that occurred in 2002 and resulted in replacement of the hood, front bumper cover, front-left fender, and left side skirt, as well as a repaint of the body apart from the rear decklid.",

      "The four-spoke airbag steering wheel is wrapped in blue leather and frames a central tachometer, a 180-mph speedometer, combination gauges, and an analog clock, while a boost gauge sits ahead of the shifter. The six-digit odometer shows 30k miles, approximately 350 of which were added by the selling dealer.",
      "The 3.6-liter M64/50 flat-six came equipped with the X88 power kit from the factory, which added modified cylinder heads and camshafts, altered timing, larger-capacity fuel injectors, and a larger turbocharger and intercooler. Output was rated at 380 horsepower and 384 lb-ft of torque when new.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a G50/52 five-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. Turbo S models were fitted with a stronger flywheel and clutch compared to the contemporary Turbo. A quad-exit exhaust system with modified heat exchangers was also standard on the Turbo S.",

      "This 1992 Lamborghini Diablo was sold new in California and remained with the first owner for over 20 years before being sold to the second owner in 2013 and acquired by the current owner in 2015. The car is finished in Nero and features 17″ OZ Racing wheels, retractable headlights, scissor doors, and a rear wing. Inside, the fixed-back bucket seats are trimmed in black leather and accompanied by a gated shifter, automatic climate control, and an Alpine stereo linked to a CD changer. Power is supplied by a 5.7-liter V12 linked with a five-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential, and test pipes have been installed in place of the catalytic converters. Now showing 34k kilometers (~21k miles), this Diablo is offered on dealer consignment in Sheridan, Colorado, with an owner’s manual, a tool kit, one vehicle key, the removed catalytic converters, and a clean Colorado title.",
      "The Marcello Gandini-designed Diablo debuted in January 1990 and featured composite and aluminum bodywork. This example is finished in Nero and has been repainted. Details include retractable headlights as well as fog lights, scissor doors, a vented engine cover, a rear wing, and quad exhaust outlets. The selling dealer notes that the finish on the doors does not match the rest of the car.",
      "The 17″ OZ Racing multi-piece alloy wheels were mounted with 245/40 front and 335/35 rear Pirelli P-Zero Asimmetrico tires in May 2023. Stopping power is provided by ventilated disc brakes at each corner.",
      "The cockpit houses fixed-back bucket seats trimmed in black leather, which extends to the dash and doors. An Alpine cassette stereo is linked to a CD changer, and further amenities include automatic climate control as well as power windows, mirrors, and door locks. The selling dealer notes that the leather on the dash has shrunk.",
      "The leather-wrapped steering wheel wears an embossed Raging Bull insignia and is paired with a gated shifter. VDO instrumentation consists of a 220-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 7,500-rpm redline as well as auxiliary gauges for oil pressure, oil temperature, coolant temperature, fuel level, and voltage. The six-digit odometer shows 34k kilometers, approximately 3k of which have been added under current ownership.",
      "The 5.7-liter V12 was factory rated at 485 horsepower and 428 lb-ft of torque. Power is routed to the rear wheels via a five-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential. The engine was removed in order to service the clutch fork in 2014. Work in 2023 involved replacing the clutch slave cylinder, battery, radiator fan blade, and coolant hoses along with the clutch fluid, engine oil, and coolant.",
      "Aftermarket test pipes have been installed in place of the removed catalytic converters, which will accompany the car.",
      "A tool kit and other accessories are also included in the sale along with an owner’s manual and one vehicle key.",
      "The Carfax report notes a lien on the car, though the Colorado title indicates that the lien was released in March 2020."

      "This 1989 Lamborghini Countach is one of approximately 658 examples of the 25th Anniversary variant built during a three-year production run and is finished in Nero Tenebre over Champagne leather. Power is from a 5.2-liter quad-cam V12 equipped with CIS fuel injection and mated to a five-speed manual gearbox. Equipment includes a limited-slip differential, scissor doors, a rear wing, fog lights, 15″ OZ Racing multi-piece wheels, a gated shifter, an Alpine CD stereo, and electronic climate control. The car was built in April 1989 and it was listed on BaT in March 2019 before being acquired by the Arizona-based selling dealer in 2023. This Countach shows 10k kilometers (~6,200 miles) and is offered with manufacturer’s literature, service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Arizona title.",
      "Originally penned by Marcello Gandini, the Countach’s bodywork was updated by Horacio Pagani for the 25th Anniversary edition that debuted in 1988. This US-market example was built in April 1989 and is finished in Nero Tenebre. A rest-of-world front bumper has been fitted, and there are cracks on the rear bumper cover as well as stone chips on the front bumper and side rocker panels. Imperfections are presented in the gallery below.",
      "OZ Racing 15″ multi-piece alloy wheels are mounted with 225/50 front and 345/35 rear Pirelli P Zero tires. The Countach features a fully independent suspension with coil springs and telescopic shock absorbers, and stopping power is provided by four-wheel ventilated disc brakes. The brake lines were replaced in 2016 and the fluid was most recently flushed in November 2023.",
      "The power-adjustable bucket seats are upholstered in Champagne leather with black piping. Interior appointments include a gated shifter, an Alpine CD stereo, electronic climate control, and power windows. The right door strut and the door seals were replaced and the dash was reupholstered in November 2023, after which the rear decklid upholstery was replaced. The driver seat motor and seat belt reels were replaced in preparation for the sale, and the passenger window switch was repaired.",
      "The leather-wrapped steering wheel fronts a 320-km/h speedometer and a tachometer with a 7,500-rpm redline along with gauges for voltage, oil temperature, oil pressure, coolant temperature, and fuel level. The six-digit odometer shows 10k kilometers (~6,200 miles).",
      "The Bizzarrini-designed 5.2-liter V12 features a 60° cylinder bank angle, four valves per cylinder, and Bosch K-Jetronic fuel injection. Revised intakes on the 25th Anniversary Countach allowed for the radiators to be mounted vertically for improved cooling. Output was factory rated at 420 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque, which is sent to the rear wheels through a five-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential. A $49k engine-out service in September 2016 involved overhauling the fuel injection system, refurbishing the engine externals, and replacing the hoses, mounts, and gaskets as well as installing a Kevlar clutch. Work since November 2023 included replacing the battery, expansion tank cap, fuel pump fuse, and spark plug boots along with changing the engine, transmission, and differential oils. Compression test results are presented in the gallery.",
      "Additional underside photos are shown in the gallery.",
      "The Carfax report shows no accidents or other damage."

      "This 2009 Alfa Romeo 8C is one of a planned 500 Spiders built between 2008 and 2010 and one of approximately 35 examples designated for the US market. The car is powered by a 4.7-liter F136 V8 mated to a six-speed semi-automatic transaxle with a limited-slip differential, and it is finished in Rosso Alfa over black leather upholstery. Equipment includes cloverleaf-style 20” alloy wheels, ceramic-composite brakes, bi-xenon headlights, a power-operated black soft top, and a carbon-fiber windshield frame along with carbon-fiber sport seats, a Becker CD stereo, and dual-zone automatic climate control. The car was previously offered on BaT in March 2022 and December 2022, and was acquired by the selling dealer in 2023. Now with 2,200 miles, this 8C Spider is offered with manufacturer’s literature, a trickle charger, tools, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Florida title.",
      "Designed by Wolfgang Egger at Centro Stile Alfa Romeo, the production 8C Competizione was introduced at the 2006 Paris Motor Show. It revived the 8C name originally used for Alfa Romeo’s eight-cylinder racing cars of the 1930s and featured styling cues from the company’s post-war sporting cars across its carbon-fiber body panels, which are supported by a steel space frame. The 8C Spider was unveiled at the 2008 Geneva Motor Show.",
      "This example is finished in Rosso Alfa and features a power-operated black soft top, bi-xenon headlights, fog lights, fender vents,  a carbon-fiber windshield frame, and quad exhaust outlets. The front bumper was repaired and refinished in 2024, at which time the carbon-fiber trim and hood latch were also repaired.",
      "The cloverleaf-style 20” alloy wheels are mounted with 245/35 front and 285/35 rear Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires. Stopping power is provided by black Alfa Romeo–branded Brembo calipers over cross-drilled carbon-ceramic rotors at all four corners.",
      "The cockpit features carbon-fiber seats trimmed in black leather with red stitching and basketweave accents, which extend to the matching door panels. The dashboard and center console feature brushed aluminum and carbon-fiber trim, and additional appointments include dual-zone climate control, a Becker CD stereo, and dual roll hoops. The sticky buttons were refinished in March 2024.",
      "The leather-wrapped steering wheel features aluminum spokes ahead of paddle shifters, and the center console wears a Limited Edition badge. Instrumentation consists of a tachometer with a 7,500-rpm redline accompanied by a 210-mph speedometer and digital readouts for oil temperature, coolant temperature, and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 2,200 miles.",
      "Designed by Ferrari and Maserati, the 4.7-liter F136 YC V8 featured a 90° bank angle and a cross-plane crankshaft. It produced 444 horsepower at 7,000 rpm and 354 lb-ft of torque at 4,750 rpm when new. The head cover, spark plug, and solenoid gaskets were replaced along with the battery in preparation for the sale.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels via a six-speed semi-automatic transaxle that can be operated in five different modes of automatic or paddle-controlled shifting. A limited-slip differential was standard.",
      "The Carfax report shows no accidents or other damage."

      "This 2003 Lamborghini Murciélago is finished in Nero Aldebaran over Nero Perseus leather and is powered by a 6.2-liter V12 that drives all four wheels through a six-speed manual transmission. Now showing 23k miles, the car is equipped with a limited-slip rear differential, 18″ Speedline Corse alloy wheels, a front-axle lift system, a speed-activated rear spoiler, xenon headlights, automatically deploying rear intakes, automatic climate control, and a CD stereo. The car was sold new by Platinum Motors, LLC of Santa Ana, California, and spent time in Europe and Canada before being brought back to the US in 2024. This Murciélago is now offered in New York by a retail dealership in Canada with a window sticker, the owner’s manual, service records, a Carfax report, and an Ohio title.",
      "The Murciélago was designed by Luc Donckerwolke and was publicly unveiled in 2001 at the Frankfurt Motor Show as the replacement for the Diablo. This example is finished in Nero Aldebaran and features a speed-activated rear spoiler, a pantograph windshield wiper, xenon headlights, scissor doors, rear fog lights, dual exhaust outlets, and automatically deploying rear intakes to aid in cooling. The front bumper was repainted in 2022.",
      "Staggerd-width 18″ Speedline Corse alloy wheels are mounted with Pirelli P Zero tires measuring 235/35 up front and 335/30 out back. Stopping power is provided by Lamborghini script calipers fitted over cross-drilled two-piece rotors at each corner. The car is equipped with active dampers and a front-axle lift system.",
      "The manually adjustable seats are trimmed in Nero Perseus leather, which extends to the dashboard, door panels, center console, and headliner. Interior elements include automatic climate control power windows, a gated shifter, and inboard shoulder restraints. Scratches are present on the center console and wear is visible on the driver’s seat boltsers and the soft-touch coating near the Kenwood head unit.",
      "The leather-wrapped three-spoke steering wheel frames a 220-mph speedometer, a tachometer, and gauges for fuel level, coolant temperature, oil pressure, and oil temperature. The digital odometer indicates 23k miles, a handful of which have been added under current ownership.",
      "The mid-mounted 6.2-liter V12 has been fitted with an aftermarket exhaust system. An oil change was performed in April 2022, the starter was replaced in November 2022, and fuel lines were replaced in April 2024.",
      "Power is sent to all four wheels through a six-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip rear differential.",
      "The window sticker lists initial delivery to Platinum Motors of Santa Ana, California, along with equipment, options, and a manufacturer’s suggested retail price of $281,100.",
      "The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage up to the most recent entry in May 2023. A gap in entries can be seen between May 2003 and July 2022."

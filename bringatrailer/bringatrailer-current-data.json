      "This 2021 Porsche 718 Cayman GT4 Clubsport is a Competition example equipped with a Manthey-Racing (MR) package, and it was imported from Asia to the US under prior ownership. Power comes from a 3.8-liter flat-six mated to a six-speed PDK dual-clutch gearbox with a mechanical differential lock, and the car rides on three-way-adjustable coilovers and forged 18″ BBS alloy wheels. Finished in Pure White under a multicolor vinyl wrap, the car features aluminum-steel and carbon-fiber bodywork as well as a rear wing, a rear diffuser, and a polycarbonate windshield. The race-prepped cabin is outfitted with an integrated roll cage, Recaro fixed-back racing seats, Schroth harnesses, a carbon-fiber 911 GT3 R steering wheel, a VBOX video system, and a Chillout cooling system. Work performed since the current owner’s acquisition in 2023 has involved replacing the left front wheel and part of the radiator assembly along with repairing portions of the bodywork. This 718 GT4 is now offered on dealer consignment with manufacturer’s documentation, spare wheels and tires, and a bill of sale.",
      "The GT4 Clubsport was offered as a track-focused version of the 982 GT4 and available in either Trackday or Competition trims. This Competition example features an aluminum-steel composite body shell, natural-fiber composite door materials, a fixed rear wing, and intake scoops built into the quarter panels. The MR package added a polycarbonate windshield and rear window, a natural-fiber lip spoiler and diffuser, and a carbon-fiber hood, fenders, and bumper fascias.",
      "A multicolor vinyl wrap has been applied to the bodywork, which left the factory finished in Pure White. The left-side fender, headlight assembly, and rocker panel were repaired under current ownership following a collision during track use.",
      "Staggered-width 18″ BBS GT4 MR forged alloy wheels are mounted with Michelin Pilot Sport tires. The MacPherson-strut suspension features three-way-adjustable coilovers and adjustable sway bars. The brakes are equipped with adjustable-bias dual master cylinders as well as six-piston front and four-piston rear monobloc aluminum calipers over multi-piece slotted rotors. The car is also equipped with an air jack system.",
      "The cabin is protected by a roll cage with door bars and houses two Recaro P1300 GT racing seats equipped with Schroth harnesses. A Chillout cooling system has been added along with a Racelogic data logger, a Motorola radio, and a VBOX video system with front- and rear-facing cameras.",
      "The GT4 Clubsport Competition package specified a 911 GT3 R carbon-fiber steering wheel that is mounted to a quick-release hub and fronts a Cosworth color LCD screen with an integrated data logger. The digital odometer indicates 3,900 miles.",
      "The mid-mounted 3.8L flat-six was factory rated at 425 horsepower and features VarioCam Plus. Part of the radiator assembly was replaced under current ownership.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a rigidly mounted six-speed PDK dual-clutch gearbox with a mechanical differential lock.",
      "Spare wheels and tires are included in the sale.",
      "The car is not legal for road use, has not been registered for the street, and carries no title or registration. It is being sold on a bill of sale."

The 3.6-liter flat-six was removed from the car in June 2018 to be decarbonized and resealed, while the six-speed manual transaxle received a replacement clutch, flywheel, pressure plate, and rear main seal. The car is finished in Arena Red Metallic over Marble Grey partial leather, and additional features include a black dashboard with light rootwood trim, a black soft top, 17″ Cup II wheels, power-adjustable front seats, air conditioning, and cruise control. This 993 Carrera cabriolet is now offered in Nevada by the seller on behalf of the current owner at no reserve with the owner’s manual, service records, a tool kit, a clean Carfax report, and a clean California title.",
      "The car is finished in Arena Red Metallic (L84S) and features a power-retractable black soft top as well as headlight washers, fog lights, power-adjustable mirrors, a speed-activated rear spoiler, and dual exhaust outlets. Paint blemishes are shown up close in the gallery.",

      "The cabin features seating surfaces trimmed in Marble Grey leather and a black dashboard accented with light rootwood trim. Amenities include power-adjustable front seats, cruise control, air conditioning, and a Becker-Porsche CDR-220 stereo. The headliner is sagging in areas, and the seller notes that the radio needs a code to operate.",
      "The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames VDO instrumentation including a central tachometer with a 6,800-rpm redline, a 180-mph speedometer, an analog clock, and gauges for oil pressure, oil temperature, oil level, and fuel level. The trip odometer gears are broken, and while the six-digit odometer shows 72k miles, true mileage is unknown.",
      "The air-cooled 3.6L M64 flat-six features a VarioRam intake system and was factory rated at 282 horsepower and 250 lb-ft of torque. A June 2018 service involved decarbonizing and resealing the engine. In May 2022 the engine mounts, drive belts, the alternator, a fuel line, the engine lid struts, and the AC evaporator, receiver/drier, and expansion valve were replaced, and an oil change was performed in preparation for the sale.",

      "This 2022 GMC Hummer EV is an Edition 1 pickup that was acquired by the current owner on BaT in December 2022, and a matte metallic gray vinyl wrap was subsequently applied over the truck’s Interstellar White paintwork. The Ultium Drive e4WD system sends power to all four wheels via a single-motor front unit with an electronic locking differential as well as a dual-motor rear axle with virtual locking capability. Additional features include the Illumination Package, 18″ wheels, CrabWalk four-wheel steering, Super Cruise driver assistance, Watts to Freedom launch control, a 24-module 200-kWh Ultium battery pack, air-ride adaptive suspension, UltraVision underbody cameras, a power-retractable tonneau cover, a 5’ pickup bed, Bose audio, Jet Black and light gray leather upholstery, touchscreen infotainment with navigation, and a MultiPro tailgate with an integrated Kicker audio system. This Hummer EV Edition 1 has 625 miles and is now offered at no reserve in Pennsylvania by the seller on behalf of the owner with a clean Carfax report and a clean Montana title in the name of the owner’s LLC.",
      "Production of Edition 1 examples began in late 2021 at GM’s “Factory Zero” Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly Center in Michigan, with each truck finished in Interstellar White with a black roof, bumpers, running boards, and wheel-arch flares. This example was wrapped in matte metallic vinyl following the owner’s acquisition, and it features an Infinity Roof with four removable tinted glass Sky Panels as well as LED headlights and cargo-area lighting, roof clearance lights, front and rear recovery hooks, heated and power-folding mirrors, and a 5’ bed with a Kicker audio system integrated into the MultiPro tailgate. A power-retractable tonneau cover was also optioned from the factory. The optional Illumination Package added front off-road auxiliary lights, tailgate step lighting, and side mirror projection lights with Hummer EV logos.",
      "Edition 1 equipment includes the Extreme Off-Road Package, which added black 18” aluminum wheels with machine-finished accents, 305/70 Goodyear Wrangler Territory M/T tires, rocker-panel rock sliders, underbody skid plates, ball spline half shafts, and underbody cameras. The CrabWalk four-wheel steering system allows the rear wheels to turn up to 10°, enabling the truck to travel diagonally at low speeds. Additional features include regenerative braking, a four-corner air-ride suspension with adaptive dampers, and a Watts to Freedom launch control system.",
      "The cabin features Jet Black and light gray leather upholstery covering the seats, while bronze trim accents the dashboard which is also fitted with an “Edition 1” badge. Appointments include heated and ventilated front seats with 12-way power adjustment, four-way lumbar-support control, driver-seat position memory, and Hummer EV insignias. Additional amenities consist of an infotainment system with a 13.4” color touchscreen as well as Bose surround-sound audio, the Super Cruise system, the Illumination Package, tri-zone automatic climate control, heated rear seats with storage compartments, and an UltraVision system providing 18 exterior camera views including front and rear underbody cameras. The front “eTrunk” features a power-operated hood that opens to reveal 11.3 cubic feet of space along with an under-floor storage bin.",
      "The heated steering wheel fronts a configurable digital display panel. The digital odometer indicates 625 miles, approximately 70 of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The front “eTrunk” features a power-operated hood that opens to reveal 11.3 cubic feet of space along with an under-floor storage bin.",
      "A single-motor front-drive unit with a 13.3:1 fixed gear ratio is housed with an electronic locking differential, while a rear-axle unit with a fixed 10.5:1 ratio incorporates two motors that can be synchronized to simulate a locking differential. The Ultium battery pack is composed of 24 pouch-style vertical cell modules in two layers and is compatible with 800-volt/350-kW fast-charging stations. A battery was replaced in December 2022.",

      "This 1996 Rover Mini Cooper was imported to Canada from Japan under previous ownership before being acquired by the seller in 2022. It was subsequently repainted in grey with a white roof and fitted with a Mk I-style grille, taillights, faux door hinges, and dashboard as well as a Superlite wood-rimmed steering wheel, Smiths instrumentation, and replacement seats trimmed in brown upholstery. The car wears quad WIPAC driving lights as well as black wheel arch extensions and rides on a Hi-Lo suspension kit along with 10″ Revolution four-spoke wheels. Power is from a fuel-injected 1.3L inline-four linked to a four-speed manual transaxle, and further equipment includes a custom exhaust system in addition to 7.9″ front disc brakes. This modified Mk VI Cooper is now offered in Ontario, Canada, with a clean Carfax report and Ontario registration.",
      "The car left the factory finished in British Racing Green with a Diamond White roof and was repainted in Dove Grey with a Snowberry White roof under current ownership, according to the seller. A Mk I-style grille and taillights as well as faux-external door hinges have been added. A leather hood strap, Austin Cooper S badging, quad WIPAC driving lights, bullet-style mirrors, and black wheel arch extensions with bright trim are further details.",
      "Black-finished 10″ Revolution four-spoke wheels feature polished rims and are mounted with 165/70 Falken FK-07E tires. The car is equipped with 7.9″ front disc brakes as well as a Hi-Lo suspension kit.",
      "The bolstered front bucket seats and rear bench are trimmed in brown upholstery with white piping and complemented by a color-coordinated shift boot and door and side panels. Billet hardware accents the cabin, and black carpets line the floors. Additional details include a heater, three-point seatbelts, and tinted sun visors. The air conditioning system is inoperative.",
      "A Superlite wood-rimmed steering wheel fronts a backdated dashboard housing a Smiths tachometer as well as a centrally mounted 220-km/h speedometer and auxiliary gauges. The speedometer is inaccurate and the oil pressure gauge is inoperative. The five-digit odometer shows 23k kilometers (~14k miles), approximately 10k of which have been added under current ownership. True mileage is unknown.",
      "The 1.3L A-series inline-four features single-point injection (SPi) and was factory-rated at 62 horsepower and 70 lb-ft of torque. According to the seller, work under current ownership has involved changing the timing chain, rebuilding the alternator, and changing the oil along with replacing the thermostat, engine air filter, cooling lines, and vacuum hoses.",
      "Power is sent to the front wheels through a four-speed manual transaxle. A sump guard and a custom exhaust system have been installed. The seller notes that rust was repaired on the floor and battery pans.",
      "Decoding the VIN tag provides the following information:",
      "The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage from a single April 2022 entry.",
      "The vehicle is being sold on its Ontario registration, which serves as the ownership document in Ontario, Canada. The sale does not include a title."

      "This AM General M1123 HMMWV was originally designated for use by the US Military before being acquired by the seller in 2020. Subsequent work involved performing a four-door conversion, refinishing the body in gray bedliner material, and installing steel front and rear bumpers as well as a hood scoop, a winch, LED headlights, side steps, and 17″ KMC alloy wheels. The interior has been fitted with bucket seats trimmed in black leather in addition to four-point harnesses, custom storage boxes, and a Pyle Bluetooth-capable sound system. Power comes from a 6.5-liter diesel V8 linked with a four-speed automatic transmission and a dual-range transfer case, and additional equipment includes a roll cage, a custom-fabricated underbody guard, and aftermarket suspension components. This M1123 “Humvee” is now offered at no reserve with a clean Arizona title in the seller’s name that lists the truck as a 2010 model year.",
      "The High-Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) went into production for military use in 1984, and the later M1123 variant was used primarily by the United States Marine Corps. This example is said to have received a four-door conversion before being finished with gray bedliner material under current ownership. Modifications include custom-fabricated front and rear bumpers, a partial roof covering, LED headlights, NAOEVO LED auxiliary lights, a ZESUPER winch, a hood scoop, a hood-mounted shovel and pick axe, side steps, and a custom-fabricated HUMMER tailgate logo. The windshields and washer fluid reservoir were replaced, and a locking fuel filler door was fitted.",
      "The 17″ KMC alloy wheels are mounted with 38×13.5″ Nitto Trail Grappler M/T tires. The suspension has been modified with aftermarket coil springs and rear A-arms, and the rubber CV boots were replaced, according to the seller. Braking is handled by inboard-mounted discs.",
      "The front and rear bucket seats are trimmed in black leather with diamond-pattern inserts, while the exposed metal surfaces are finished in gray bedliner material. Diamond plate flooring lines the footwell, and details include Kyostar four-point harnesses for each occupant, a custom-fabricated roll cage, ammo box-style storage boxes, and a Pyle Bluetooth-capable audio receiver and speakers.",
      "A MOMO Competition steering wheel sits ahead of LED-backlit instrumentation consisting of a 60-mph speedometer and auxiliary gauges for oil pressure, fuel level, coolant temperature, and voltage. The five-digit odometer shows 434 miles, and approximately 4k miles have been added under current ownership. Total chassis mileage is unknown.",
      "The reverse-hinged hood opens to reveal the 6.5-liter diesel V8. Work performed since 2020 is said to have involved refurbishing the alternator and replacing the starter, voltage regulator, and radiator fluid overflow tank.",
      "Power is sent to all four wheels through a four-speed automatic transmission and a dual-range transfer case. The seller states the flywheel and a driveshaft were replaced. A custom-fabricated underbody guard was fitted, and a diesel fluid leak is noted.",
      "The data plate shown above lists serial number 211057 as well as a rebuild date of February 2010."

      "This 1940 Cadillac Fleetwood Series 60 Special sedan is a non-running project that is said to have been used as a police car under previous ownership before it was purchased by the current owner’s late husband in 1983. The car is finished in black over gray cloth upholstery and retains a 346ci Monobloc V8, a three-speed manual transmission, chrome bumpers with overriders, dual spotlights, a wood-rimmed steering wheel, and an under-dash cassette player. It is unknown when the car was last run, and maintenance will be required prior to use. This 60 Special is now offered on dealer consignment at no reserve with a clean California title in the owner’s name.",
      "The Fleetwood-built bodywork was delivered from the factory in Chicory Green Metallic (13) and was repainted black under previous ownership. Features include chrome bumpers and overriders, a hood ornament, an antenna, and dual spotlights. Wear in the paint and other imperfections in the finish can be seen in the gallery.",
      "Body-color wheels wear chrome hubcaps, and they are mounted with Columbia Deluxe bias-ply whitewall tires. A spare wheel is stowed beneath the trunk floor. The 60 Special rode on a 127″ wheelbase and featured an X-frame chassis with a coil-sprung independent front suspension and rear semi-elliptical leaf springs. The car retains hydraulically assisted drums at all four corners.",
      "The cabin features bench seats trimmed in gray cloth with color-matching door panel centers and carpets. Dark gray vinyl accents the upper and lower door panels and the front bench, and additional features include an AM radio, a locking glovebox, an under-dash Optimus cassette player, kick panel-mounted speakers, a rear footrest, and a rear folding armrest.",
      "The wood-rimmed steering wheel fronts a painted steel dashboard housing a 100-mph sweep speedometer and auxiliary gauges. A three-gauge pod is mounted beneath the dash. The five-digit odometer shows under 58k miles, and a Hobbs hour meter has been added in the engine bay and shows 174 hours. Total mileage is unknown.",
      "The 346ci Monobloc V8 features three main bearings and was factory rated at 135 horsepower. It is unknown when the car was last run, and maintenance will be required prior to use.",
      "The car retains a column-shifted three-speed manual transmission. Corrosion on the undersides can be seen in the gallery.",

      "This 1980 Mercedes-Benz 230C is a European-market coupe that was reportedly first delivered in Germany and was imported to Canada in the 1990s, and it was acquired by the seller on BaT in July 2021. The 2.3-liter inline-four was overhauled by Metric Motors of Los Angeles, California, in 2022, and additional work under current ownership included adjusting the carburetor, overhauling the ignition and cooling systems, and installing a Becker Europa AM/FM/cassette stereo with replacement speakers. Finished in green over beige vinyl and cloth, the car also features a four-speed automatic transmission, dual side mirrors, 14″ Bundt wheels, European-specification bumpers and headlights, and a cabin heater. This C123 shows 120k kilometers (~74k miles) and is offered with factory literature, service records from current ownership totaling approximately $35k, and Connecticut registration in the seller’s name.",
      "The body left the factory finished in Cactus Green (880) and was repainted in May 2007. Features include European-specification bumpers and single-piece glass headlights, chrome trim, and a single polished exhaust outlet. Various replacement window and body seals were installed in 2022. An insurance claim in the amount of CA$3,215.75 was made in May 2006 according to an ICBC Vehicle Claims History Report provided in the previous listing.",
      "Silver-finished 14″ Bundt wheels were mounted with 195/70 Vredestein Quatrac 5 tires under current ownership. Braking is handled by four-wheel discs. The rear anti-roll bar links were replaced in 2022 along with various power steering hoses.",
      "The seating surfaces are trimmed in beige vinyl with cloth inserts, while Zebrano woodgrain trim accents the contrasting dashboard, center stack, and center console. A Becker Europa AM/FM/cassette stereo was installed under current ownership along with replacement speakers.",
      "The four-spoke steering wheel fronts a 200-km/h speedometer, a clock, and gauges for fuel level, coolant temperature, and oil pressure. The six-digit odometer shows 120k kilometers (~74k miles), approximately 3k of which were added by the seller. Replacement dashboard backlight bulbs were installed in 2022.",
      "The 2.3-liter M115 inline-four drives the rear wheels through a four-speed automatic transmission. Maintenance under previous ownership involved replacing the distributor cap and rotor in 2019 and servicing the alternator in 2020. The engine was rebuilt by Metric Motors of Los Angeles, California, in 2022, and additional service at that time included replacing the following components:",
      "The carburetor was adjusted in February 2023.",
      "Additional underside images are provided in the gallery.",
      "Factory literature is included in the sale. Service records from current ownership totaling approximately $35k can be viewed in the gallery below.",
      "The car does not have a title, as it is located in a state that does not issue titles to vehicles of its age. It is being offered on its Connecticut registration, which displays “Antique” under the Registered Usage heading."

The cabin was reupholstered in gray vinyl and microsuede, and appointments include air conditioning, a full-length center console, Dakota Digital gauges, and a Bluetooth head unit linked to high-performance speakers. Acquired by the seller in 2016, this modified Chevelle is offered with a clean Nevada title in the seller’s name.",

A custom lower valance is fitted and the rear quarter panels were modified to accommodate the quad exhaust outlets.",

The front air dam, roof, and hood were repainted while a fender was repaired in 2023.",

    "description": [
      "This 1970 Buick Estate Wagon was refurbished around 2006 and was later featured in the 2013 Steve Carell film The Way, Way Back. The seller acquired the vehicle in late 2013. Powered by a 455ci V8 linked to a three-speed automatic transmission, the car is finished in green with woodgrain paneling and a black vinyl roof over green vinyl upholstery. Other equipment includes three rows of bench seating, styled wheels, power steering, a dual exhaust system, a luggage rack, power windows, air conditioning, and an eight-track player. This LeSabre-based Estate Wagon is now offered with movie memorabilia, manufacturer’s literature, a 2010 article from The Buick Bugle that documents the refurbishment, service records from current ownership, and a clean California title in the seller’s name.",
      "Finished from the factory in Seamist Green (45), the car was repainted under prior ownership in the late 2000s. The body sides and the tailgate are accented by faux-woodgrain paneling. A black vinyl roof covering was fitted during the aforementioned refurbishment. Features include a wind deflector above the rear window as well as a luggage rack, chrome bumpers and trim, dual side mirrors, and fender ventiports. Massachusetts inspection labels from 1970 and 2013 are applied to the windshield, and an assortment of travel-themed stickers decorate the rear side windows. Blemishes in the paint, cuts in the woodgrain appliqué, and other imperfections are pictured in the gallery below, and rust is noted in the lower corners of the doors.",
      "Chrome-plated five-spoke 15″ wheels with black accents are mounted with 235/75 Maxxis MA-1 whitewall tires. The car has power steering, and braking is provided by power-assisted drums at all four corners.",
      "The cabin features three rows of bench seats trimmed in green vinyl. Interior appointments include power windows, air conditioning, an eight-track player, cruise control, lap belts, green carpeting, and green floor mats. The top of the dashboard is faded, the driver’s door power-window switch is not functional, and the seller notes low volume output from the AM/FM radio.",
      "The two-spoke steering wheel has woodgrain trim and fronts a 120-mph speedometer. The five-digit odometer shows 22k miles, approximately 500 of which were added under current ownership. The gear selection indicator is not functional. The odometer rolled over in the early 2000s, and true mileage is unknown.",
      "The rear-facing third-row bench seat can be folded flat, and so can the second row. The two-way tailgate drops down or swings open.",
      "The 455ci V8 is topped by a four-barrel carburetor. A dual exhaust system was installed in 2014 under current ownership. An oil change and a tune-up were performed most recently in 2023.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a three-speed automatic transmission.",
      "Script pages, a rental/release agreement, a hat, and call sheets from The Way, Way Back are included in the sale and shown in the gallery along with screen grabs of articles about the movie from 2013 and 2014."

      "This 2000 Mercury Grand Marquis LS was ordered with the Handling and LS Ultimate packages, and it remained registered with its first owner in Tennessee from new until it was acquired by the selling dealer in February 2024. Now indicating 26k miles, the car is finished in Silver Frost Clearcoat Metallic over Light Graphite leather, the car is powered by a 4.6-liter SOHC V8 paired with a four-speed automatic transmission. It is also equipped with a dual exhaust system, a numeric keyless entry keypad, rear air suspension, anti-lock disc brakes, 16″ aluminum wheels, a digital instrument cluster, automatic climate control, cruise control, and a factory cassette stereo. This Grand Marquis is offered at no reserve with a clean Tennessee title.",
      "The car is finished in Silver Frost Clearcoat Metallic (TS). Exterior details include a numeric keyless entry keypad, cornering lamps, and power-adjustable mirrors with body-color caps. The Carfax report notes that the front of the car sustained “functional” damage in a May 2011 accident, and the seller states that cracks in the rear bumper cover were repaired before the rear bumper cover was refinished in preparation for the sale. Blemishes around the body are identified by the selling dealer in the gallery below.",
      "Silver-finished 16″ lacy-spoke aluminum wheels are wrapped in P225/60R16 Michelin Harmony tires with production date codes from 2008.

      "This 2004 Bentley Arnage T was listed on BaT in October 2019 before it was acquired by the seller in 2021, and it now has 42k miles. Subsequent work is said to have included replacing the steering rack, serpentine belt, transmission mount, sway bar links, lower control arm bushings, and tires. The car is powered by a twin-turbocharged 6.75-liter V8 linked to a four-speed automatic transmission and is finished in black over Linen Connolly leather. It has 19″ two-piece five-spoke wheels, multi-zone automatic climate control, a sunroof, rear-passenger picnic tables, cruise control, heated and power-adjustable front seats, navigation, and a CD stereo with a six-disc CD changer. This Arnage T is now offered with manufacturer’s literature, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Florida title in the seller’s name.",
      "Black paint finishes the body, and exterior details consist of a sunroof, front fender vents, a body-color grille shell, parking sensors, and round quad headlights. The front bumper cover was repainted under previous ownership.",
      "The 19″ two-piece five-spoke wheels are mounted with 255/45 Vredestein Quatrac Pro tires that were reportedly replaced at 32k miles. The sport-tuned suspension features a double-wishbone independent design that is supplemented by a computer-controlled adaptive electro-hydraulic damping system, and traction control, stability control, and ride height control came standard. The lower control arm bushings were replaced in 2021, the brake fluid and power steering fluid were changed in December 2022, and the seller states that a replacement steering rack and sway bar links were installed in 2024.",
      "The cabin features seating surfaces upholstered in Linen Connolly leather with diamond-stitched inserts. Amenities include heated and power-adjustable front seats, multi-zone automatic climate control, rear-passenger picnic tables, a leather headliner, aftermarket all-weather floor mats, burl oak trim, cruise control, navigation, and a CD stereo with six-disc CD changer. The cabin air filters were replaced in December 2022. The right-rear window regulator is inoperative.",
      "A leather-wrapped steering wheel fronts a digital display flanked by a 170-mph speedometer and a tachometer. A clock and gauges for coolant temperature, voltage, oil pressure, and fuel level are centrally mounted in the wooden dash fascia. The digital odometer indicates 42k miles, approximately 10k of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The twin-turbocharged 6.75-liter V8 was factory rated at 450 horsepower and 645 lb-ft of torque. The serpentine belt is said to have been replaced in 2021. The oil was most recently changed in December 2022, and the seller notes that the air filters were replaced at that time.",
      "Power is delivered to the rear wheels via a GM-sourced 4L80-E four-speed automatic transmission. The transmission was most recently serviced in December 2022.",
      "Manufacturer’s literature is included in the sale.",
      "The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage."

      "This 1968 Datsun 510 race car was first listed on BaT in 2019 and then bought by the selling dealer in 2021. It was subsequently rebuilt to compete in the B-Sedan class, and work included repainting the body, overhauling the suspension, reworking the cockpit, installing a Rebello-built L18 engine, a 280ZX five-speed manual transmission, a Cusco limited-slip differential, and Koni/QA1 adjustable shocks, and replacing the gauges, fuel cell, driveshaft, U-joints, brake hoses, wheel bearings, and tie rod ends. This 510 race car is now offered in Colorado with a bill of sale.",
      "The car was repainted in dark blue with a white engine bay and interior following the selling dealer’s purchase in 2021.",
      "Over 150 photos of the build process are provided in the gallery.",
      "The suspension and brakes were overhauled following the 2021 auction. Work included returning the rear cross member to factory specification, repairing and reinforcing the front subframe, repairing the front control arms, sandblasting and powdercoating the suspension components, converting the rear brakes back to drums, installing adjustable Koni front shocks, adjustable QA1 rear shocks, and upgraded sway bars, and replacing the brake lines, wheels bearings, and tie rod ends.",
      "The wheels are 13×7″ Rotas and they are mounted with 205/60 Toyo R888R tires.",
      "Cockpit changes under current ownership have included modifying the roll cage to ease entry and exit, repairing rust, repainting the sheet metal in white, fabricating a new dashboard, door panels, and interior panels, and replacing the gauges and switchgear.",
      "Instrumentation includes an AutoMeter Pro-Comp II Tachometer and Steward-Warner gauges for fuel pressure, oil pressure, voltage, water temperature, and oil temperature.",
      "The 1.8L L18 inline-four was installed during current ownership and the selling dealer notes that it was built by Rebello Racing. The engine is equipped with twin Mikuni sidedraft carburetors, Ermish Racing headers, and an Ermish Racing exhaust system.",
      "The selling dealer also installed a close-ratio 280ZX five-speed manual transmission, a Cusco 4.11:1 limited-slip differential, a replacement driveshaft and U-joints, and an ATL fuel cell."

      "This 1985 BMW M635CSi is a German-market example that was imported to the US and federalized in 1985 by its original owner, with whom the car remained until the selling dealer acquired it in 2024. Power comes from a 3.5-liter M88/3 inline-six mated to a five-speed manual transmission, and the car left the factory finished in Diamond Black Metallic over black leather upholstery. Equipment includes 17″ Racing Dynamics five-spoke wheels, headlight wipers, fog lights, a power sunroof, and a decklid spoiler as well as manually adjustable front sport seats, air conditioning, and an Alpine CD stereo. This E24 M635CSi is now offered with manufacturer’s literature, documents relating to the 1985 import, service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean California title.",
      "The car is finished in Diamond Black Metallic and features a power sunroof, headlight wipers, and a front air dam with fog lights as well as a power antenna, a decklid spoiler, and twin off-center exhaust outlets. Photos showing chipped paint on the mirror caps and around the front of the car are provided in the gallery.",
      "Racing Dynamics 17″ five-spoke alloy wheels are mounted with 235/45 BFGoodrich Advantage Control all-season tires. The car is equipped with MacPherson struts up front and a semi-trailing arm suspension setup out back as well as Bilstein shocks and front and rear anti-roll bars. Braking is handled by power-assisted four-wheel discs with ABS and ventilated front rotors.",
      "The manually adjustable front sport seats and the rear bench are upholstered in black leather, while the door panels are accented with gray leather. Amenities include air conditioning, an onboard computer, and an Alpine head unit connected to a trunk-mounted CD changer and aftermarket amplifiers as well as BMW-branded carpeted floor mats, and power-operated windows, mirrors, and locks. Scuffs are visible on the front seat upholstery.",
      "The M Tech I steering wheel fronts a tachometer with a 6,500-rpm redline as well as a 160-mph speedometer and gauges for coolant temperature and fuel level. The six-digit mechanical odometer shows 285k miles, approximately 100 miles were added by the selling dealer. The factory speedometer has been replaced with a US version, therefore true mileage is unknown. Areas of wear are visible on the steering wheel.",
      "The 3.5-liter M88/3 inline-six features Bosch Motronic fuel injection and was factory rated at 282 horsepower and 251 lb-ft of torque.",
      "Power is delivered to the rear wheels via a five-speed manual transmission",
      "The Carfax report begins with a January 1991 entry and is free of accidents or other damage.",
      "The car was designated a Gross Polluter by the state of California in December 2000 and has since passed a California emissions test, most recently in February 2023."

Acquired by the selling dealer in 2024, this R230 is now offered at no reserve with the owner’s manual, two keys, a Carfax report, and a clean Ohio title.",
      "The car is finished in Brilliant Silver Metallic and has a power-folding convertible hardtop, a panoramic glass roof, bi-xenon headlights with washers, fog lights, dual exhaust outlets, fender air vents, and the AMG Styling Package, which added a revised front fascia and side skirts.

      "This 1963 Chevrolet C10 Fleetside pickup was acquired out of Arizona by the seller in 2018 and underwent a refurbishment that was completed in 2021. Work involved refinishing the truck in orange and white, refreshing the coordinated interior, and lowering the ride height. Power is provided by a 230ci inline-six paired with a four-speed manual transmission, and equipment includes Hedman headers, 15″ steel wheels, polished hubcaps, lowering springs and shocks, a wood-plank bed floor, a push-button AM radio, and aftermarket instrumentation. This C10 is now offered with a clean Florida title in the seller’s name listing the truck as a 1964 model.",
      "The truck is equipped with a Fleetside bed and is refinished in orange with a white cab. Wood planks and body-color runners line the bed floor, and replacement components include the windshield, weatherstripping, rear window, rear bumper, front grille, mirrors, trim, and vent windows.",
      "White 15″ steel wheels wear polished hubcaps and are mounted with 235/75 Nexen tires. Revised suspension includes 5″ front and 4″ rear lowering springs, an adjustable panhard bar, and replacement ball joints and tie rods. The seller notes that the wheel cylinders and shoes for the four-wheel drum brakes were replaced in preparation for the sale.",
      "The cabin houses a bench seat trimmed in white and orange, and the color scheme extends to the door panels and dashboard. A push-button Delco AM radio and replacement carpets are fitted, and the shifter is topped with a beer tap handle.",
      "The two-spoke white steering wheel frames an aftermarket 160-mph speedometer and readouts for fuel level, voltage, water temperature, and oil pressure. The odometer shows 2,800 miles, and total mileage is unknown.",
      "The 230ci inline-six sends power to the rear wheels via a four-speed manual transmission. An aluminum radiator with an electric fan is fitted, and Hedman headers feed twin exhaust outlets that exit in front of the left rear wheel. The spark plugs and wires, ignition coil, and carburetor were replaced under current ownership."

      "This 1991 Land Rover Defender 90 is a right-hand-drive hardtop that was imported to the US under previous ownership and then refurbished and modified. Work involved fitting a Project Kahn wide-body kit, a repaint in matte silver, and installing a supercharged 6.2-liter LS3 V8 mated to a 6L80 six-speed automatic transmission and a dual-range transfer case. The truck is also equipped with 20” Black Rhino wheels, Old Man Emu shocks, auxiliary lighting, a NAS-style rear bumper, tan leather-trimmed aftermarket seats, custom interior wood paneling, air conditioning, a microfiber headliner, a rearview camera, and an Alpine sound system. It was previously sold on BaT in February 2023, and subsequent work included overhauling brake and suspension components, repairing a leak from the fuel tank, and replacing the rear differential before it was sold again on BaT in December 2023. Recently re-acquired by the selling dealer, this modified Defender 90 is offered with an accident-free Carfax report and a Califonia title listing the truck as a 1990 model.",
      "Along with the Project Kahn wide-body kit, the truck has a modified Puma hood, an X-Lander grille, LED headlights and auxiliary lighting, fender vents, alpine windows, a NAS-style rear bumper, and Masai rock sliders.",
      "Gray 20″ Black Rhino Armory wheels are mounted with 33″ Gladiator QR900-M/T tires, and a smaller spare is affixed to the rear cargo door. Old Man Emu shocks and sway bars are noted, and stopping power is provided by four-wheel disc brakes. Work in August 2023 included rebuilding the power steering and brake booster pump along with repairing the brake master cylinder, flushing the brake fluid, replacing the rear brake pads, and realigning the rear brake calipers. Suspension bump stops were also fitted at that time.",
      "Beneath a color-keyed microfiber headliner, the aftermarket bucket seats are trimmed in tan leather, while black leather, microfiber, and custom wood trim accent the two-passenger cabin, which has been lined with sound-deadening insulation. Air conditioning, power windows and locks, a push-button gear selector, an Alpine touchscreen, and a rearview camera are additional elements.",
      "A MOMO steering wheel frames a 200-mph speedometer flanked by gauges for coolant temperature, oil pressure, voltage, fuel level, and boost pressure. The odometer shows 1,400 miles. The Carfax report states that a Not Actual Mileage title was issued for the vehicle in February 2024, and total mileage is unknown.",
      "A custom enclosure located behind the rear seats houses two subwoofers and amplifiers.",
      "The 6.2-liter LS3 V8 was installed under previous ownership and is equipped with a 4.0-liter Whipple supercharger, Trick Flow cylinder heads, and MagnaFuel and Holley fuel system components.",
      "Power is routed to all four wheels through a 6L80E six-speed automatic transmission, a dual-range transfer case, and custom drive shafts. The truck also has long-tube headers, a Flowmaster Flow FX muffler, a front skid plate, and a fuel tank guard. The transmission mount, driveshaft hardware, rear differential, rear axles, and rear wheel hub spacers were replaced in August 2023, at which time the front axle drive flanges were overhauled, a fuel leak was repaired, and a custom overflow canister was added.",
      "The Carfax report shows the aforementioned Not Actual Mileage entry.",
      "The vehicle has not been inspected by the California Bureau of Automotive Repair."

Acquired by the current owner approximately eight years ago, it is described a running project that has recently been driven a short distance following a period of long-term storage. The car is finished in yellow with black stripes and features quad rectangular headlights and a rear hatch along with Western 13″ and 14″ alloy wheels. Inside, bolstered bucket seats trimmed in patterned black and gray upholstery are accompanied by an AM/FM cassette stereo as well as VDO and  Cronomac instrumentation. Power is from a 1.6L flat-four fitted with dual downdraft carburetors, while shifting is through a four-speed manual transaxle. This Ventura project is now offered at no reserve in California by the seller on behalf of the owner with a clean Arizona title that lists the car as a 1989 Puma.",
      "L’Automobile Distribuidora de Veículos Ltda. was founded in São Paulo, Brazil, by Claudio Campuzzano and Guillermo Pardo. From 1975 to 1983, the company produced kit car components as well as complete vehicles based on Volkswagen chassis and running gear. The fiberglass body of this Ventura is finished in yellow with black stripes and is said to have been repainted under previous ownership. Details include quad rectangular headlights, dual side-view mirrors, a rear hatch, and Ventura badging. Cracks in the paint and other blemishes are visible around the car.",
      "Western 13″ front and 14″ rear alloy wheels are mounted with Bridgestone Potenza tires measuring 185/70 and 205/70, respectively. Stopping power is from four-wheel drums, and the brake fluid was flushed in preparation for the sale. The seller recommends adjusting the brakes and notes a clanking sound from the suspension.",
      "The bosltered bucket seats are upholstered in patterned black cloth with contrasting gray accents. Black vinyl covers the dash and door panels, while black carpets line the floors. An AM/FM cassette stereo with a built-in equalizer is located in the center stack, and further details include a glovebox, three-point seatbelts, and door-mounted controls for adjusting the side-view mirrors.",
      "A three-spoke steering wheel is paired with a floor-mounted shifter fitted with a golf ball knob. Instrumentation includes a VDO 7k-rpm tachometer along with a Cronomac 200-mph speedometer and auxiliary gauges indicating voltage, coolant temperature, and fuel level. The five-digit odometer shows 1 mile, and total mileage is unknown.",
      "The air-cooled 1.6L flat-four is fitted with dual Weber downdraft carburetors. The oil was changed in preparation for the sale. The car has not passed a California emissions test.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels via a four-speed manual transaxle. Rust is present on the underside."

It is powered by a 4.2-liter 2F inline-six that has been fitted with a Holley Sniper electronic fuel injection system, an FiTech Fuel Injection fuel pump, a Davis Unified Ignition distributor, and a Tri-Mil exhaust header. Finished in green with a removable hardtop and a white roof over black vinyl, the truck is equipped with a four-speed manual transmission, a dual-range transfer case, Old Man Emu shock absorbers, and 15″ steel wheels with polished hubcaps as well as a Gobi Stealth roof basket and ladder, a Warn winch, a high-lift jack, Bestop Trailmax front bucket seats, inward-facing rear bench seats, a Specter Off-Road roll bar, three-point front seatbelts, Vintage Air climate control, and a Tuffy locking center console. This FJ40 is offered by the seller on behalf of the owner with a repair manual, parts receipts, spare parts, and a clean California title.",
      "Finished from the factory in Rustic Green (621), the truck was repainted under previous ownership and a rubberized 3M coating was applied to the wheel wells in preparation for the sale.

Recent work is said to have involved installing front driving lights and dual telescoping hinged side mirrors as well as replacing the windshield, weather stripping, door handles, and various exterior lights. Chips are noted on the right rear window and other exterior blemishes are pictured in the gallery below.",
      "The 15″ steel wheels with polished hubcaps are mounted with 30×9.5″ Falken Wildpeak AT3W tires, and a matching spare is affixed to the swing-out rear tire carrier. The truck is equipped with Warn manually locking front hubs, Old Man Emu shock absorbers, and four-wheel drum brakes.

      "This 1983 Land Rover 110, nicknamed “Grey Goose”, was modified and mechanically refurbished by The Landrovers of Amsterdam prior to being imported to the US under prior ownership. The build included repainting the body and fitting it with a roof rack, a Puma-style hood, LED auxiliary lights, 18″ Sawtooth wheels, and a 2″ suspension lift as well as refreshing the interior with brown leather upholstery, an Alpine touchscreen stereo, and an aftermarket air conditioning system. Power is from a 3.5-liter V8 linked to a four-speed manual transmission and a dual-range transfer case. This Land Rover 110 is offered by the seller in Rhode Island on behalf of the current owner with a Florida title listing the truck as a 1985 model.",
      "The truck was repainted gray during the build, and it has been modified with the installation of a roof rack, a Puma-style hood, a KBX grille, LED auxiliary lights, Fire & Ice-style side steps, and a Mantec spare tire carrier.",
      "The 18″ Sawtooth wheels are mounted with Cooper Discoverer STT Pro tires. The truck is equipped with a 2″ suspension lift and front disc brakes.",
      "The front bucket seats, inward-facing rear bench seats, door panels, dash pad and center console lid were reupholstered in brown leather during the refurbishment, which also included replacing the headliner, carpets and seat belts. Appointments include an Alpine touchscreen head unit, Alpine speakers, an aftermarket air conditioning system, and Land Rover-branded rubber floor mats.",
      "The replacement steering wheel fronts a 110-mph speedometer and supplementary gauges. The six-digit odometer shows 2,200 miles, which is said to represent the total mileage added since the refurbishment. Total mileage is unknown.",
      "The 3.5-liter V8 was overhauled during the refurbishment.",
      "Power is sent to the rear or all four wheels through an LT95 four-speed manual transmission and an LT230 dual-range transfer case, both of which are said to have been overhauled during the build."

      "This 1979 Mercedes-Benz 450SL was sold on BaT in December 2021 before it was acquired in 2024 by the selling dealer, who proceeded to overhaul the air conditioning system and replace the fan clutch and fuel accumulator. The car now shows 56k miles and is finished in English Red over Creme Beige leather upholstery. Power comes from a 4.5-liter V8 mated to a three-speed automatic transmission, and equipment includes a dark brown convertible soft top, a removable hardtop, 14″ Bundt alloy wheels, fog lights, a Pioneer CD stereo, power windows, and automatic climate control. This R107 is now offered with manufacturer’s literature and a clean Ohio title.",
      "The car is finished in English Red (504) and features a color-matched removable hardtop and a dark brown convertible soft top. Additional exterior equipment includes fog lights, a power antenna, and chrome-accented bumpers, mirrors, and trim. A paint correction process is said to have been performed in preparation for the sale and paint meter readings can be viewed in the gallery below.",
      "Silver-finished 14″ Bundt alloy wheels are mounted with 205/70 Hankook Kinergy ST tires. The car was factory-equipped with power steering and power-assisted four-wheel disc brakes. The brake fluid was flushed in preparation for the sale.",
      "The bucket seats are upholstered in Creme Beige leather that extends to the center console and door panels, while woodgrain trim accents the cabin. A Pioneer CD head unit has been installed and other amenities include automatic climate control, cruise control, central locking, and power-operated windows. The wood trim behind the shifter is cracked.",
      "The four-spoke steering wheel frames VDO instrumentation including a 160-mph speedometer, a 7k-rpm tachometer, an analog clock, and gauges for coolant temperature, oil pressure, and fuel level. The six-digit mechanical odometer shows 56k miles, approximately 300 miles were added by the selling dealer.",
      "The 4.5-liter M117 V8 features Bosch K-Jetronic fuel injection and was factory rated at 180 horsepower and 220 lb-ft of torque. The air conditioning system was overhauled by the selling dealer in June 2024 with a replacement compressor, dryer, and expansion valve and recharged with R134a refrigerant. Additional work included changing the oil and replacing the fan clutch along with the fuel filter and accumulator.",

      "This 2004 Porsche 911 Turbo cabriolet is finished in Speed Yellow over black leather upholstery and is powered by a twin-turbocharged 3.6L flat-six that drives all four wheels via a six-speed manual transaxle. It is equipped with a limited-slip differential, a black soft top, 18″ Turbo Twist wheels, and yellow-finished brake calipers along with optional lowered and heated seats, a Sport shifter, a Bose sound system, and a stainless-steel exhaust system. The car was first delivered to Manhattan Motorcars of New York, New York, and was sold on BaT in August 2021 before it was acquired by the current owner on BaT in June 2023. This 996 Turbo cabriolet has 5k miles and is offered in California on dealer consignment with a wind deflector, two keys, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Montana title.",
      "The car is finished in Speed Yellow (12H) with a black convertible soft top. Additional features include xenon headlights, fog lights, a speed-activated rear spoiler, and polished exhaust outlets as well as wider rear bodywork, rear air intakes, and revised bumper covers in comparison to the contemporary Carrera. XPEL paint protection film was applied to parts of the hood, front fenders, and mirror caps under previous ownership. Blemishes are evident on the leading edge of the front spoiler.",
      "The 18″ Turbo Twist wheels are mounted with Bridgestone Potenza S-02A tires measuring 225/40 up front and 295/30 at the rear. The car is equipped with Porsche Stability Management (PSM) and an automatic brake differential. Braking is from yellow-finished four-piston calipers over vented and cross-drilled rotors at all four corners. Brake and power steering fluid changes were performed in 2021.",
      "The cabin houses optional 10mm-lowered, power-adjustable, and heated front seats trimmed in black leather with yellow stitching, and matching upholstery extends to the dashboard, center console, shifter boot, handbrake lever, and door panel inserts. Amenities include lumbar support for the driver, Speed Yellow seat belts, a Sport shifter, dual-zone automatic climate control, navigation, and a Bose sound system with a six-CD changer mounted in the front trunk. The climate control display is missing some pixels.",
      "A three-spoke steering wheel with yellow stitching frames yellow instrumentation including an 8k-rpm tachometer, a 200-mph speedometer, and gauges for coolant temperature, oil pressure, voltage, and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 5k miles, approximately 100 of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The twin-turbocharged 3.6L Mezger flat-six had a factory rating of 415 horsepower and 415 lb-ft of torque. An oil change was performed in 2022.",
      "Power is sent to all four wheels through a six-speed manual transaxle. The clutch was reportedly replaced under previous ownership. The car is equipped with an optional stainless-steel exhaust system.",
      "The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage."

      "This 1965 Chevrolet Impala SS was acquired by the seller’s late father in the early 2010s and was subsequently refurbished. Powered by a 396ci V8 linked to a four-speed automatic transmission, the car is finished in red over black vinyl upholstery. Equipment includes air conditioning, front bucket seats, a retro-style radio, dual antennas, dual exhaust, styled wheel covers, power brakes, power steering, electronic ignition, an aluminum radiator, and an electric cooling fan. This Impala is now offered by the seller on behalf of the late owner’s estate with a clean Arizona title in the name of the owner’s trust.",
      "Finished from the factory in Regal Red (RR), the car was repainted during the aforementioned refurbishment, which reportedly involved removing the body from the frame. Features include chrome bumpers and trim, SS and Super Sport badging, six taillights, quad headlamps, dual side mirrors, dual antennas, and dual exhaust outlets. The seller notes that the paint is defective and exhibits areas of cracking.",
      "Steel wheels wear styled SS covers and are mounted with American Classic whitewall tires. The car is equipped with power-assisted brakes and power steering.",
      "The low-back front bucket seats and the rear bench are trimmed in black vinyl. Appointments include a center console, air conditioning, a retro-style radio, lap belts, dome lights, black carpeting, and rubber floor mats.",
      "The two-spoke steering wheel has a partial horn ring and fronts a horizontal 120-mph speedometer flanked by a combination gauge and a readout for manifold vacuum. A Stewart-Warner gauge for water temperature is mounted beneath the dashboard to the left of the steering wheel, and a clock is located ahead of the shifter. The five-digit odometer shows less than 700 miles, and true mileage is unknown. The car has not been driven regularly since late 2021.",
      "The 396ci V8 was reportedly rebuilt under prior ownership around 2010, and the air-cleaner cover has Turbo-Jet 325HP markings. Modifications include electronic ignition, an aluminum radiator, and an electric cooling fan.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a 700R4 four-speed automatic transmission.",
      "The chassis number is appropriate for a 1965 Chevrolet Impala SS two-door hardtop that was built in Southgate, California, and equipped with a V8 engine. Decoding the Fisher body tag shown above reveals the following production information:"

It is powered by a 1,979cc V-twin paired with a five-speed manual transmission and is finished in metallic blue with chrome vinyl livery over Orange leather. Equipment includes the Urban Cooling Kit, 19″ wire-spoke front wheels, dual side exhaust pipes, Brooklands-style windscreens, bright dual roll hoops, a MOMO steering wheel and shift knob, and VDO instrumentation. This 3-Wheeler is offered on dealer consignment with a blue Mohair tonneau cover, factory books and tools, and a clean Florida title.",
      "The aluminum body was delivered from the factory in primer and was disassembled and initially painted for presentation in MOMO’s SEMA booth in chrome with a translucent blue topcoat and MOMO livery. The car has since been refinished in metallic blue with chrome-style vinyl MOMO livery. The #30 honors MOMO’s historic sponsorships of the Porsche 935 IMSA GTP and Ferrari 333SP LMP race cars. Equipment includes outboard-mounted headlights, a leather bonnet strap, Brooklands-style windscreens, dual mirrors, dual roll hoops and headrests, a Le Mans-style fuel filler cap, and a dual exhaust system with perforated black heat shields.",
      "Black 19″ wire-spoke front wheels are mounted with Excelsior Comp H tires, while a single 15″ wheel with a Yokohama Avid tire is positioned under the rear bodywork. Stopping power is provided by disc brakes up front and a drum out back.",
      "The two-person cockpit features seating trimmed in diamond-stitched Orange leather joined by matching armrests. Appointments include a MOMO shift knob, three-point seatbelts, storage pockets, aircraft-style toggle switches, and a power outlet under the dashboard.",

A Maier Racing Enterprises E-body kit was installed in 2006 along with flared steel fenders and custom rockers with side-exit exhaust outlets, and approximately $79k worth of bodywork and painting were performed in 2012. The Pepper Grey Metallic paintwork is complemented by black stripes and a black soft top, and the hood has a scoop and is mounted on billet hinges and secured by pins.",

Dynamat insulation has been installed under the carpeting, and a push-button starter and hard-wired radar detector have been installed. The Kenwood stereo is linked to a custom sound system with Focal speakers and JL Audio subwoofers, and it has a back-up camera system mounted in the fuel filler cap.",

    "description": [
      "This 1993 Mazda ɛ̃fini RX-7 Type R is a right-hand-drive example that was imported to the US under prior ownership before being acquired by the seller in 2021. The car is powered by a twin-turbocharged 1.3-liter Wankel rotary engine mated to a five-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential, and it is finished in silver over black upholstery. Equipment includes 17″ Enkei alloy wheels, aftermarket coilover suspension, a front lip spoiler, an R1-style rear wing, and a Sony head unit linked to a trunk-mounted subwoofer as well as a Mishimoto aluminum radiator and an aftermarket exhaust system. Work performed in 2022 involved fluid changes in addition to replacing the coilovers, door latches, and spark plugs. This FD RX-7 has 84k kilometers (52k miles) and is offered with receipts for work performed under current ownership and an Oregon title in the seller’s name that lists the car as a 1995 model year.",
      "The FD generation of the RX-7 was first sold under the ɛ̃fini brand in Japan, with the Type R marketed as its lightweight, sport version. This example was finished from the factory in Silver Stone Metallic (4G) and was repainted under prior ownership. Features include pop-up headlights, fog lights, a front spoiler, front fender vents, an R1-style rear wing, and ɛ̃fini badging. Paint imperfections on the front bumper cover and spoiler are noted.",
      "Silver-finished 17″ Enkei alloy wheels are mounted with 255/40 front and 275/40 rear Falken Azenis RT615K+ tires. The suspension is said to have been fitted with Tein coilovers in January 2022, and braking is provided by four-wheel rotors with Mazda-branded calipers up front.",
      "The 2+2 cabin features front bucket seats upholstered in black cloth, while bolstered rear seats are trimmed in black vinyl. A Sony head unit linked to a trunk-mounted Kicker subwoofer has been retrofitted, and additional appointments include aluminum pedals, woven floor mats, and power windows and door locks. The door latches were replaced in July 2022. The seller notes the air conditioning system does not work, the center console armrest is missing, the driver’s door storage box lid is cracked, and the front seat upholstery is worn.",
      "The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a central tachometer, a 180-km/h speedometer, and gauges for fuel level, coolant temperature, and oil pressure. An aftermarket Blitz boost pressure gauge is affixed to the steering column. The digital odometer indicates 84k kilometers (~52k miles), approximately 1k of which have been added under current ownership.",
      "The 1.3-liter 13B Wankel rotary features sequential twin-turbochargers. The fuel filter and spark plugs were replaced in January 2022, and a Mishimoto aluminum radiator is said to have been installed in April 2022. Compression test results can be viewed in the gallery below, and the plastic engine tray is missing.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a five-speed manual transmission and a Torsen limited-slip differential. The catalytic converters have been removed and an aftermarket exhaust system has been fitted. The transmission and rear differential fluids were changed in January 2022."

      "This 1954 Oldsmobile Super 88 Holiday two-door hardtop was purchased new in Florida and remained with the family of its original owner until it was sold from California to Washington in 2011. The vehicle was subsequently returned to California and modified for competition in the 2014 running of the Mille Miglia Storica in Italy, after which it was offered as a BaT Exclusive in July 2014 and relocated to Virginia. The FantomWorks television show on the Velocity Channel featured the car in a 2015 episode that focused on preparing it for additional racing events, and the vehicle returned to the Mille Miglia field in both 2018 and 2019 and also has competed in two Colorado Grand tours. Powered by a 324ci Rocket V8 paired with a three-speed Turbo Hydramatic automatic transmission, the car is finished in turquoise and white over a blue and white interior. The suspension, braking, and cooling systems have been updated for competition use, and other equipment includes a transmission cooler, an electric fuel pump, power steering, power brakes, wheel covers, lap belts, and aftermarket air conditioning. The selling dealer acquired the car in June 2024. This modified Super 88 is now offered with historical photos of a 1954 Oldsmobile that raced at the contemporaneous Mille Miglia as well as a FIVA identification card, correspondence from previous owners, service records, manufacturer’s literature, a collection of spare parts, a car cover, and a Pennsylvania title.",
      "Finished from the factory in Capri Blue with a Polar White roof (40-60), the vehicle is said to have been repainted decades ago while under the care of the original owner’s family. Decals from races in which the car has been campaigned adorn multiple body panels. The bumpers have been rechromed, and additional paintwork has been performed on the lower areas of the right-front fender, according to the seller, who also notes that some of the chrome is pitted.",
      "White-painted 15″ steel wheels wear styled covers and are wrapped in 205/65 Michelin Premier A/S tires. The suspension reportedly has been updated with larger sway bars as well as stiffer springs and firmer bushings. The steering is power assisted, as are the four-wheel drum brakes.",
      "The cabin features split-front and rear bench seats upholstered in white vinyl with patterned blue cloth inserts. Aftermarket air conditioning has been installed along with added switchgear for the electric fuel pump and an auxiliary cooling fan. Other appointments include blue carpeting, white and blue door panels, front and rear lap belts, a Deluxe AM radio, and dome lights.",
      "The two-spoke steering wheel features a full horn ring and fronts a 120-mph speedometer with subdials for amperage, coolant temperature, fuel level, and oil pressure. The five-digit odometer shows 12k miles, approximately 50 of which were added by the selling dealer; true mileage is unknown.",
      "The 324ci Rocket V8 features a “bat wing” air cleaner placed above a Rochester four-barrel carburetor. An electric fuel pump has been added, and the oil was changed in preparation for the sale.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a three-speed Turbo Hydramatic automatic transmission that has been modified with an oil cooler and a TCI Automotive pan.",
      "The Identity Card issued by the Fédération Internationale des Véhicules Anciens (FIVA) is shown above. The included service records, manufacturer’s literature, and spare parts are pictured in the gallery below.",
      "Historical photos of a different 1954 Oldsmobile that raced at the Mille Miglia in the 1950s will accompany the vehicle.",
      "The Pennsylvania title carries a Classic brand and lists the body type as sedan."

Toggle-switch controls are positioned under additional gauges for coolant temperature, oil pressure, voltage, boost, and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 5,600 miles, approximately 40 of which were added under current ownership.",

The car spent time in long-term storage during prior ownership and since the current owner’s 2013 acquisition. The car is powered by a turbocharged 3.8-liter V6 paired with a four-speed automatic transmission and is finished in black over two-tone black and Sand Gray upholstery. Details include a limited-slip differential, 16″ cross-lace wheels, composite wheel arch flares, fender vents, a rear spoiler, air conditioning, and cruise control. This GNX is now offered on dealer consignment with a clean California title.",
      "The Grand National Experimental was created in partnership with McLaren Performance Technologies/ASC to celebrate the end of the vehicle’s production run, and all 547 examples were finished in black. Cosmetic details specific to the GNX include heat-extracting fender vents, composite wheel arch flares, a three-piece rear spoiler, and GNX badging. Additional exterior details include a rear window defogger, sport mirrors, and dual exhaust outlets.",
      "This is a relist after the vehicle was previously sold on BaT in July 2024 and the winning bidder failed to follow through with their commitment to purchase. This was not due to any fault with the vehicle. The winner’s participation on BaT has been restricted and their buyer’s fee was not refunded.",
      "The GNX features front suspension components from the contemporary Grand National, and upgraded rear components include a Panhard rod, torque arm, and an additional frame crossmember. Braking is handled by power-assisted front discs and rear drums.",
      "Black-finished factory 16″ cross-lace wheels wear GNX-branded center caps along Goodyear Eagle VR50 tires.",
      "The front bucket seats and rear bench are upholstered in black and Sand Gray cloth, and Turbo 6 embroidery adorns the front seat headrests. Amenities include a power-adjustable driver’s seat, air conditioning, cruise control, power windows, and a Delco cassette stereo with a graphic equalizer.",
      "A plaque mounted to the passenger side of the dashboard identifies this as GNX #450.",
      "The leather-wrapped steering wheel fronts GNX-specific Stewart-Warner instrumentation consisting of a 160-mph speedometer, an 8k-rpm tachometer, and gauges for boost, oil pressure, coolant temperature, and fuel level. The five-digit odometer shows 26 miles, a few of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The 3.8-liter V6 was modified by ASC/McLaren with a Garrett T3 turbocharger under a heat shield with GNX lettering along with a larger air-to-air intercooler and a low-restriction exhaust system. Factory-rated output was 276 horsepower and 360 lb-ft of torque. An oil change was performed in preparation for the sale.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a 200R4 four-speed automatic transmission with a factory-upgraded oil cooler, and the limited-slip differential features a GNX-branded aluminum cover.",
      "The Carfax report is free of accidents or other damage from the first entry in 2001 through the final entry in 2021."

    "description": [
      "This 1952 Mercedes-Benz 300 S is one of 203 examples built with Cabriolet A coachwork during three years of production and was invoiced to its first owner in Coahuila, Mexico, on December 5, 1952. Beginning in 1961, the car passed through a series of Mexico City owners, including a 16-year span under the stewardship of architect Francisco Artigas during which it was returned to Mercedes-Benz in Germany in 1969 for a mechanical refurbishment and also received a color change to black over tan leather. It was purchased in 2007 for its current owner’s museum collection in Mexico City and subsequently underwent a multiyear refurbishment that was completed in 2017 before the car was imported to the US in 2024. Power is provided by a 3.0-liter M188 inline-six that breathes through triple Solex carburetors and is paired with a column-shifted four-speed manual transmission. Additional features include four-wheel independent suspension, finned hydraulic drum brakes, a black convertible top, and a Becker Grand Prix radio. The W188 is now offered on dealer consignment in San Diego, California, with a copy of its original sales invoice, factory data cards, ownership documentation dating back to new, a 2008 inspection report, refurbishment photos, a brochure, an owner’s manual, a matching luggage set, and a clean Montana title.",
      "The 300 S was introduced at the Paris Motor Show in October 1951 as a hand-built sporting version of the four-door 300 series and rode on a wheelbase 150mm shorter than the sedan variant. It entered production the following summer in three configurations including a coupe, a roadster, and a cabriolet, the latter of which was distinguished from the roadster by a more substantial convertible top flanked by landau bars. The 300 S models were succeeded in 1955 by the fuel-injected 300 Sc range.",
      "Originally finished in green, this example’s bodywork received a color change to black circa the 1970s and was again repainted in black after being stripped to bare metal during the refurbishment performed under current ownership. Various stone chips are noted in the finish. Features include front and rear bumper guards, front fog lights, a driver-side mirror, a fender-mounted antenna, and a black convertible top with bright landau bars.",
      "Chrome 15” wheels wear covers with body-color accents and are mounted with 215/75 BFGoodrich Silvertown whitewall tires, while dual trunk-mounted spares wear Firestone whitewall rubber. Braking is handled by finned drums all around, and the brake system is said to have been rebuilt in preparation for the sale.",
      "The cabin is trimmed in tan leather over the reclinable front seats, fold-down rear bench seat, door panels, and side panels. Features include color-keyed carpeting, wood dash and door-cap accents, roll-up windows, a lockable glovebox, a rectangular VDO clock, and a Becker Grand Prix radio. Imperfections are noted in areas of the wood finish.",
      "The black two-spoke steering wheel hosts a bright horn ring and sits ahead of VDO instrumentation including a 200-km/h speedometer and gauges monitoring oil pressure, coolant temperature, fuel level, and amperage. The five-digit odometer shows 10k kilometers (~6k miles), approximately 44 of which have been added since the car’s arrival in the US.",
      "The 3.0-liter SOHC M188 inline-six features an aluminum cylinder head that mates to the block at a 30° diagonal to allow increased valve sizes, with induction handled by triple Solex carburetors. Output was factory rated at 150 horsepower. The engine is said to have been overhauled during the refurbishment performed under current ownership, while an oil change was performed in preparation for the sale.",
      "Engine number 18892000059/52 is stamped on the block as well as on a tag affixed to the engine, which also carries a “tauschaggregat,” or exchange unit, tag. The transmission and rear end are also said to be marked as factory-repaired or -replaced units.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels via a four-speed manual transmission with synchromesh on all forward gears. The four-wheel independent suspension features coil springs and telescopic shock absorbers at each corner.",
      "Copies of two versions of the factory data cards accompany the car, including the above document that describes the car as a Sonderschau Mexiko, or Mexican Special Exhibition car. A sales invoice dated December 5, 1952, is viewable in the photo gallery below and lists the original colors, options, and component numbers as well as delivery to its original owner in Mexico. Invoices from Mercedes-Benz from 1970 for DM 2,306.22 and $6,038 can be viewed in the gallery along with various ownership documents from throughout the car’s life."

    "description": [
      "This 1977 Lamborghini Countach LP400 is one of approximately 150 Periscopio examples manufactured during the first four years of the Countach model’s production. Chassis 1120262 left the factory in right-hand-drive configuration and was purchased new by best-selling British pop musician Sir Rod Stewart while on tour in Australia. The car later moved with Stewart to Los Angeles, where it was modified with a wide-body kit and a targa-style roof panel before being relocated to the UK and remaining in Stewart’s private collection until 2002. It was converted to left-hand drive under the stewardship of its second owner before being purchased in 2013 by an owner who commissioned a refurbishment returning its bodywork to factory configuration while retaining the left-hand-drive configuration. Further refurbishment work reportedly carried out in 2022 by Lamborghini Polo Storico is said to have included servicing of the powertrain, brakes, and steering system as well as a return of the interior to LP400 specifications before the car was purchased by the selling dealer in 2023. Finished in Rosso over Tobacco leather, the car is powered by a 3.9-liter quad-cam V12 that is equipped with six Weber carburetors and twin-distributor ignition. Additional features include a five-speed manual transmission, a limited-slip differential, four-wheel coil-sprung independent suspension, four-wheel ventilated disc brakes, Campagnolo 14” alloy wheels, Stewart-Warner gauges, and air conditioning. This LP400 Periscopio is now offered by the selling dealer in Los Angeles with a binder of registration documents and service records dating back to 1990, invoices from the work performed in 2022 and 2024, and a clean Montana title.",
      "Using the project code LP112, Lamborghini began the development of a successor to the Miura in 1970 before unveiling a prototype bearing the Countach name at the 1971 Geneva Motor Show. The Countach platform underwent three years of refinement before entering production as the LP400 with aluminum bodywork styled by Bertone’s Marcello Gandini wrapped over a steel spaceframe built by Marchesi. Design elements include a wedge-shaped profile with trapezoidal panel lines, pop-up headlights, air boxes protruding from the sail panels, NACA ducts on each flank, scissor doors, and a periscope-style angular roof depression carried over from the prototype.",
      "This example’s bodywork was reportedly modified in the 1980s by Costa Mesa-based Albert Madikian Engineering with front and rear spoilers, wheel arches, and removal of the roof to create a targa configuration. A refurbishment initiated in Europe in 2013 included the installation of a replacement factory-look periscope roof panel and removal of the body extensions as well as a repaint in the original shade of Rosso. The door seals, trunk seal, and engine compartment seal were replaced during a service completed in June 2024. Closeups of the finish, trim, and lenses are shown in the photo gallery below. The seller notes that the photos were taken prior to the replacement of the seals.",
      "Replacement Campagnolo five-bolt alloy wheels are said to have been sourced from France and are wrapped in Michelin XWX tires measuring 205/70VR14 up front and 215/70VR14 at the rear. Dual-circuit Girling ventilated disc brakes are said to have been refreshed during the 2022 refurbishment.",
      "The cabin was re-trimmed in 2022 and features Tobacco leather over the fixed-back bucket seats, console, sills, and rear bulkhead with color-matched upholstery over the door panels. Additional features include beige carpeting, brown brushed suede over the dash and boxed instrument binnacle, a gated shifter, black shoulder belts, a passenger-side footrest, a lockable glovebox, roll-up side-window vents, and air conditioning.",
      "The three-spoke steering wheel is wrapped in black leather and sits ahead of an aluminum bezel hosting Stewart-Warner instrumentation including a 320-km/h speedometer, a 9k-rpm tachometer, and gauges monitoring voltage, amperage, oil pressure, coolant temperature, fuel level, and oil temperature. The vertically aligned five-digit odometer shows 562 kilometers (~350 miles), and true mileage is unknown.",
      "The mid-mounted 3,929cc V12 features an aluminum block with a 60° angle between cylinder banks, dual-overhead camshafts, six sidedraft Weber 45 DCOE carburetors, twin Marelli distributors, and twin coils. Factory-rated output was 370 horsepower at 8k rpm and 269 lb-ft of torque at 5k rpm. The engine was reportedly overhauled in the 2000s, while further mechanical and electrical freshening is said to have been performed in 2022. Service completed in June 2024 by Fast Cars of Redondo Beach, California, included fluid changes, replacement of the spark plugs, installation of stainless-steel fuel pickup screens, and the installation of a replacement ANSA muffler. Invoices from the work totaling close to $30k can be viewed in the gallery.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels via a five-speed manual transmission located in the middle of the car along with a limited-slip differential mounted behind the engine. Suspension comprises double wishbones up front, reverse lower wishbones and parallel trailing links at the rear, and anti-roll bars at each end. Coilover shock absorbers are utilized all around, with dual units at each rear wheel."

      "This 1997 Ferrari F355 Spider is finished in black over beige leather and is powered by a 3.5-liter DOHC V8 linked with a gated six-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. Equipment includes a black soft top, 18″ five-spoke magnesium wheels, pop-up headlights, and a Kenwood stereo hooked to a modified sound system. The car has been owned in Pennsylvania since 2002 and now shows 36k miles. Acquired by the selling dealer in August 2022, this F355 Spider is now offered with the owner’s manual, service records, a car cover, a tool kit, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Pennsylvania title",
      "The Pininfarina-designed body is finished in Nero, and styling elements include a power-operated black convertible top as well as pop-up headlights, integrated front fog lights, an integrated rear decklid spoiler, quad exhaust outlets, a vented engine cover, and air intakes on the doors and rocker panels. Work in 2022 included replacing the convertible top microswitch, main switch, and elastic strips.",
      "This is a relist after the vehicle was previously sold on BaT in June 2024 and the winning bidder failed to follow through with their commitment to purchase. This was not due to any fault with the vehicle. The winner’s participation on BaT has been restricted and their buyer’s fee was not refunded.",
      "The 18″ five-spoke magnesium wheels are mounted with Continental tires with date codes from 2011-2012. Ferrari-branded brake calipers are mounted over ventilated discs at each corner.",
      "The sport seats are trimmed in beige leather that extends to the center console, door panel inserts, and lower half of the dashboard. Amenities include a gated shifter, automatic climate control, drilled aluminum pedals, a front trunk-mounted Sony CD changer, and a Bluetooth-capable Kenwood CD stereo hooked to a custom sound system. The passenger-side dashboard upholstery is warped.",
      "The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a 200-mph speedometer, a 10k-rpm tachometer, and gauges for oil pressure and coolant temperature. Ancillary instruments in the center stack include an analog clock and gauges for fuel level and oil temperature. The six-digit odometer shows 36k miles, approximately 500 of which were added by the selling dealer.",
      "The mid-mounted 3.5-liter DOHC V8 features five valves per cylinder and dry-sump lubrication for a factory-rated output of 375 horsepower and 268 lb-ft of torque. An engine-out belt service was last completed in May 2021, and the alternator belt, spark plug wires, and belt tensioners were also replaced at that time.",
      "Power is routed to the rear wheels via a six-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential. Records indicate that the clutch components were replaced in October 2020 at 36k miles.",
      "The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage."

      "This 1982 Toyota Land Cruiser FJ40 is said to spent time in Saudi Arabia before being imported to the US from the United Arab Emirates in 2012. It was later refurbished as part of a project completed by Mideast Classics of Topeka, Kansas, in 2015 and was acquired by the current owner in 2020. The truck is finished in red over patterned vinyl upholstery and is powered by a 4.2-liter 2F inline-six linked with a four-speed manual transmission and a dual-range transfer case. Equipment includes driving lights, ambulance-style rear doors, manually locking front hubs, and 15″ steel wheels with polished hubcaps along with front disc brakes sourced from a later model Land Cruiser. The cabin features a split front bench seat, inward-facing jump seats, and a Vintage Air climate control system. This FJ40 is offered at no reserve on dealer consignment with a clean New York title.",
      "The truck was removed from the frame and refinished during the refurbishment, reportedly in Freeborn Red with a Cygnus White hardtop. Exterior features include driving lights, a pintle hitch, and ambulance-style rear doors.",
      "The 15″ steel wheels feature polished hubcaps and are mounted with 33×10.50″ BFGoodrich All-Terrain T/A KO2 tires. Power steering is said to have been added, and the selling dealer notes that a brake master cylinder and front disc brakes from a later model Land Cruiser are installed.",
      "The cabin was fitted with replacement patterned vinyl seat upholstery during the refurbishment along with a replacement headliner, dash pad, seat foam, door cards, and carpeting. A Vintage Air climate control system and floor insulation are said to have been installed.",
      "Instrumentation includes a 160-km/h speedometer and gauges for oil pressure, coolant temperature, amperage, and fuel level. The five-digit odometer shows 2,600 kilometers, (~1,600 miles), and total mileage is unknown.",
      "The 4.2-liter 2F inline-six is said to have been rebuilt during the refurbishment and is equipped with a single carburetor.",
      "Power is routed to the rear or all four wheels through a four-speed manual transmission and a dual-range transfer case. The differentials are fitted with 3.70:1 gearing according to the selling dealer."

The truck is further equipped with an NV4500 five-speed manual transmission, an Atlas dual-range transfer case, limited-slip front and rear differentials, power-assisted front disc brakes, a lifted suspension, and a Wild Horses 4×4 1″ body lift and quick-ratio power steering. Additional modifications consist of 17″ Fuel wheels, aftermarket front and rear steel bumpers, LED exterior lighting, Corbeau front bucket seats, Vintage Air climate control, Dakota Digital VHX instrumentation, and a custom exhaust system. This U15 Bronco is offered on dealer consignment with service records, a Warn VR8000-S winch, and a clean Nevada title.",

      "This 2007 Ferrari F430 Spider was first delivered to Ferrari of Newport Beach in California, and it has 20k miles following registration history in the state. Finished in Nero Daytona over tan leather with black accents and piping, the car is powered by a 4.3-liter DOHC V8 paired with a six-speed F1 automated transaxle. Equipment includes a black convertible soft top, 19″ split-spoke alloy wheels, an electronically controlled limited-slip differential, Brembo carbon-ceramic brake rotors, Scuderia Ferrari fender shields, power-adjustable Daytona-style bucket seats, and automatic climate control. This F430 Spider is now offered in New Hampshire by the selling dealer with a Ferrari Vehicle Identification Passport, a copy of the window sticker, owner’s manuals, a car cover, and a clean California title.",
      "The Pininfarina-designed body is finished in Nero Daytona and features a power-retractable black soft top, xenon headlights, Scuderia Ferrari fender shields, a carbon-fiber rear panel, and quad exhaust tips exiting on either side of the rear diffuser. Clear paint-protection film has reportedly been applied to the lower portions of the doors along with the front bumper cover, hood, fenders, headlight lenses, A-pillars, and side skirts.",
      "The 19″ split-spoke alloy wheels are mounted with Continental ExtremeContact Sport 02 tires. Braking is handled by yellow-finished brake calipers fitted over Brembo carbon-ceramic rotors. The brake fluid was flushed in preparation for the sale.",
      "The power-adjustable Daytona-style bucket seats are upholstered in tan leather with black piping and accents, and the cabin features a matching center console and door panel inserts. Equipment includes a CD stereo, air conditioning, drilled aluminum pedals, and power windows and locks.",
      "The leather- and carbon-fiber-trimmed steering wheel is equipped with an engine-start button as well as a manettino dial for control of dynamic settings. Instrumentation includes a central tachometer with an 8,500-rpm redline as well as a 220-mph speedometer and gauges for coolant temperature, oil temperature, and oil pressure. The digital odometer indicates 20k miles.",
      "The mid-mounted 4.3-liter F136 V8 features Bosch Motronic engine management and a dry-sump lubrication system. Factory-rated output was 483 horsepower and 343 lb-ft of torque, which is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed F1 automated transaxle and an electronically controlled limited-slip differential. Carbon-fiber trim adorns the engine bay. The oil and transaxle fluids were changed and the battery and spark plugs were replaced in June 2024.",
      "A photocopy of the window sticker lists initial delivery to Ferrari of Newport Beach in California along with factory equipment and a total suggested retail price of $294,215.",
      "The Ferrari Vehicle Identification Passport contains photos of the car during various phases of its construction. The sale also includes owner’s manuals and a car cover.",
      "The Carfax report shows at least one open recall."

      "This 1974 Ford Ranchero GT was refinished in metallic red under prior ownership and was exported from the US to Canada following the selling dealer’s acquisition in 2024. Power comes from a 351ci V8 equipped with a Holley four-barrel carburetor, and shifting is through a three-speed automatic transmission. On the inside, the bucket seats are upholstered in black leather with tan inserts and accompanied by a wood-rimmed steering wheel, a center console, air conditioning, and a JVC CD stereo. Further equipment includes 17″ alloy wheels, power-assisted front disc brakes, a hood scoop, a sliding rear window, and a spray-on bedliner. This Ranchero GT is now offered by the selling dealer in Canada with Ontario registration.",
      "Finished from the factory in Dark Green Metallic (4Q), the truck was repainted metallic red under prior ownership. Details include a hood scoop, dual side mirrors, chrome-finished bumpers, a sliding rear window, a spray-on bedliner, and dual polished exhaust outlets.",
      "Split-spoke 17″ alloy wheels are mounted with 215/45 Bridgestone Ecopia EP4 tires up front and BFGoodrich tires out back. The truck is equipped with power steering, and braking is handled by power-assisted front discs and rear drums.",
      "The bucket seats are upholstered in black leather with tan inserts and are joined by a color-coordinated dashboard, center console, and door panels. Air conditioning, a JCV head unit, and a locking glove compartment are further details.",
      "The wood-rimmed steering wheel sits ahead of a 120-mph speedometer, an analog clock, and readouts for fuel level and coolant temperature. Additional Equus gauges monitoring oil pressure, coolant temperature, and voltage are mounted in the center console. The five-digit odometer shows 60k miles.",
      "The 351ci V8 is equipped with a Holley four-barrel carburetor, an MSD ignition coil, and a polished air cleaner housing and valve covers.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a three-speed automatic transmission. A dual exhaust system is fitted and features Thrush mufflers.",
      "The vehicle does not have a title and is being sold on its Ontario registration, which serves as the ownership document in Ontario, Canada"

      "This 1967 Cadillac Eldorado was purchased by the current owner in 1981 and underwent modifications that were completed in 2014. A 500ci V8 and a replacement three-speed automatic transmission were installed, the roof was removed and chopped, a removable hardtop was fitted, the bodywork was repainted black, and the seats were re-trimmed in black leather. Additional equipment includes a removable tonneau cover, 15″ wheels, front disc brakes, a power-operated front bench, power front windows, aut0-dimming headlights, and a heater. This modified Eldorado is now offered in Canada by the seller on behalf of the owner with British Columbia registration.",
      "The roof was chopped and shortened, the frame was reinforced, and a removable fabric hardtop and custom tonneau cover were fitted. The seller reports that the car has undergone three color changes and was most recently refinished in black circa 2014, and red “Helldorado” script and stripes adorn the sides. Additional modifications have involved adding a rear LED light strip and removing the gas door, rear back-up light, and wheel arch trim. Paint chips and a crack on the right rear fender are noted.",
      "Steel 15″ wheels wear covers with black centers and red accent stripes. The wheels are mounted with 235/75 Hankook Radial H714 tires measuring 235/75/R15. The car is equipped with power steering, stopping power is provided by front disc and rear drum brakes, and the seller states that rear air bags are fitted.",
      "The cabin houses a power-operated front bench and a rear bench seat that have been reupholstered in black leather, and the seller reports that the carpets have also been replaced. Appointments include a fold-down center armrest, power front windows, auto-dimming headlights, and a heater. The radio does not work, and a tear in the upholstery of the driver’s seat is depicted in the gallery.",
      "The three-spoke steering wheel wears a Cadillac wreath and crest and fronts a horizontal-sweep 120-mph speedometer, gauges for coolant temperature and fuel level, and an analog clock. A trio of aftermarket readouts is mounted in the center of the dashboard. The five-digit odometer shows 6k miles, and the seller reports having added approximately 30k miles under current ownership. Total mileage is unknown.",
      "The seller notes that the 500ci V8 was sourced from a 1970 model and installed in 2010.",
      "Power is routed to the front wheels through a replacement three-speed Turbo Hydra-Matic automatic transmission.",
      "The vehicle does not have a title and is being sold on its British Columbia registration, which serves as the ownership document in British Columbia, Canada."

      "This 1954 Packard convertible was acquired by the seller in the mid-1990s out of Michigan. Powered by a replacement 327ci straight-eight linked to a replacement three-speed manual transmission with overdrive, the car is finished in red with a power-operated black soft top over red and white vinyl upholstery. The electrical system has been converted to 12 volts and PerTronix ignition, and other features include wheel covers, whitewall tires, fender skirts, power windows, and a power-adjustable front seat. This Packard 5479 is now offered in Canada with service records, manufacturer’s literature, a service manual, a jack, and Ontario registration in the seller’s name.",
      "The Cavalier-based convertible was stripped of that nameplate for the 1954 season, when it was referred to simply as the Packard convertible and 863 copies were produced. This example has been refinished in red urethane paint following rust repair, according to the seller, who notes that the power-operated black convertible top was replaced in 2000. Equipment includes fender skirts, a turned-down exhaust finisher, dual sideview mirrors, a pelican-style hood ornament, and chrome bumpers and trim.",
      "Body-color steel wheels feature Packard-branded chrome covers and are mounted with Uniroyal Tiger Paw whitewall tires.",
      "The front and rear bench seats have been retrimmed in red and white vinyl upholstery. Appointments include a power-adjustable front seat, power windows, a heater, and front lap belts. The AM radio and the clock are inoperable.",
      "A red steering wheel with a partial horn ring sits ahead of a 110-mph speedometer and a combination gauge. The five-digit odometer shows 88k miles, approximately 30k of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The 327ci inline-eight is a replacement unit that was installed under current ownership. The electrical system has been converted to 12 volts, and PerTronix ignition has been fitted. The oil was changed most recently in late 2023. The car was originally powered by a 359ci inline-eight.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a replacement three-speed manual transmission with overdrive.",
      "The vehicle is being offered on its Ontario registration, a form that serves as the ownership document in Ontario, Canada."

      "This 1997 BMW M3 sedan was modified for track use under previous ownership in 2005, reportedly for use in the BMWCCA Club Racing C-Mod class. Highlighting the modifications is a European-specification 3.2-liter S50B32 inline six, a Jim Blanton-built 3.64 differential, coilover suspension with remote-reservoir Motion Control shocks, upgraded brakes, APEX ARC-8 wheels, and front and rear spoilers. The Alpine White paintwork is accented by Motorsport-motif flags, and inside the car has a cage, an OMP seat for the driver, and an AIM dashboard. This race-prepared M3/4/5 is now offered on a bill of sale in Illinois with records.",
      "The car is finished in Alpine White III (300). A raised rear spoiler and a front splitter have been added along with fender lip extensions. The rear windows are fixed, and the left-front headlight has been removed and replaced with an intake. Sponsor and racing-style decals have been added along with Motorsport-motif flag accents, and the carbon-fiber hood is secured by pins. Several trim items are missing.",
      "The APEX ARC-8 wheels wear 275/35 Falken tires all around and are secured on studs. Motion Control two-way dampers with remote reservoirs have been installed along with height-adjustable coilover springs, aftermarket sway bars, a lower front chassis reinforcement, and a front upper stress bar. A Turner Motorsport four-piston Brembo brake kit has been installed up front, while out back Porsche 996-specification tw0-piston calipers have been installed.",
      "The interior has been stripped, and a TC Design cage was installed and finished to match the car. The doors have been gutted and the lower dashboard and center console were removed, and diamond-plate panels were installed on the floor. The driver is secured in the OMP seat by Simpson harnesses, and a transponder, a window net, fire extinguishers, a racing rearview mirror, and Sparco pedals.",
      "An AIM dashboard has been installed ahead of the factory instrumentation, and a MOMO Competition steering wheel has been installed along with an IRP shifter. The odometer indicates 66k miles.",
      "The European-specification 3.2-liter S50B32 inline-six was reportedly installed by Patrick BMW in Schaumburg, Illinois in 2001. The engine is believed to have had ~15k miles at the time of installation, and it was modified with a Autothority intake and a lightweight flywheel.",
      "The five-speed manual transmission is linked to a Jim Blanton-built differential with 3.64 gears and an Alpina cover. The stainless-steel headers are linked to a custom exhaust system with Borla mufflers.",
      "A binder of records and historical photos are included in the sale.",
      "The Carfax report shows no accidents or other damage."

Finished in orange and white with a power-operated black convertible top over an orange and white interior, the car also features front coilovers and tubular control arms, front disc brakes, power-assisted rack-and-pinion steering, a dual exhaust system, 15″ wire wheels, whitewall tires, a Continental kit, air conditioning, a power-adjustable front seat, and power windows. This modified Montclair was acquired by the selling dealer in 2023 and is now offered in Florida with a Pennsylvania title.",
      "Mercury manufactured 7,762 Montclair convertibles for 1956, and this example was finished from the factory in two-tone Persimmon and Classic White (83). The car is said to have undergone a rotisserie refurbishment under prior ownership, during which it was repainted in orange and white. Equipment includes a power-operated black convertible top, fender skirts, dual fender-mounted sideview mirrors, fog lights, a hood ornament, and chrome bumpers and trim. The dual exhaust system terminates in horizontal tailpipes that are styled around the lower surface of the rear bumper.",
      "Chrome-finished 15″ wire wheels with spinner-style centers are mounted with 205/75 BFGoodrich Silvertown Radial whitewall tires; two of the wheel centers bear Ford branding, and the other two have Chevrolet logos. A Continental kit with a body-color cover houses a spare wheel and tire, and another spare is situated inside the trunk compartment. The front underpinnings feature tubular control arms, coilovers, power-assisted rack-and-pinion steering, and power-assisted disc brakes. The rear of the car rides on leaf springs connected to a live axle capped by drum brakes. The power steering reportedly was repaired in May 2024.",
      "The bench seating surfaces have been retrimmed in orange and white upholstery. Appointments include a power-adjustable front seat, power windows, air conditioning, a clock, a push-button AM radio, bright trim, black carpeting, and orange carpeted floor mats.",
      "The three-spoke steering wheel frames a 120-mph speedometer positioned below auxiliary gauges. Aftermarket gauges monitoring voltage, oil pressure, and water temperature are located below the dashboard, alongside aftermarket climate controls. The five-digit odometer shows 93k miles, less than 50 of which were added by the selling dealer; true mileage is unknown.",
      "The 5.0-liter Coyote V8 was installed under prior ownership and features quad camshafts as well as twin independent variable camshaft timing. The engine is augmented by an aluminum radiator with electric cooling fans plus a cold-air intake, exhaust headers, and MagnaFlow mufflers.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels via a 4R70W four-speed automatic transmission and a Currie 9” differential.",

      "This 1991 Buick Roadmaster Estate wagon was modified under prior ownership, which included removing the exterior trim and door handles, fitting a rear roll pan, installing an aftermarket grille and headlights, and repainting the car in pearl white with light blue upper sections. The car rides on adjustable air springs and 20″ American Racing wheels, and it is powered by a 5.0-liter V8 linked with a four-speed automatic transmission. The cabin is trimmed in Camel leather and outfitted with power-adjustable front seats, woodgrain trim, electric door poppers, air conditioning, cruise control, a rear-facing third-row bench, and a Sony head unit. This modified Roadmaster Estate is offered by the selling dealer in Texas at no reserve with the owner’s manual and a clean California title.",
      "The exterior was repainted in pearl white with light blue upper sections, and the exterior trim and door handles were removed, electric door poppers were installed, and a rear roll pan, taillight trim, aftermarket headlights, and a revised front grille were fitted during the build. Further details consist of a Vista Roof over the second-row seats and dual exhaust outlets. The Carfax report notes an entry in April 2006 in which the vehicle was involved in a rear-end collision, and the trim is separating from the roof.",
      "American Racing 20″ wheels are mounted with Falken Azenis tires. The car rides on adjustable air springs that are controlled in the cabin. It was factory equipped with power steering, and braking is provided by power-assisted front discs and rear drums.",
      "The power-adjustable front seats are separated by a center console and are trimmed in Camel leather and vinyl. Appointments include cruise control, a microsuede headliner, air conditioning, and a Sony head unit mounted in the glove compartment as well as a power-operated rear window, side windows, locks, and mirrors.",
      "The cargo area is accessed via a dual-hinged tailgate and features a fold-down rear-facing bench seat. The fuel filler has been relocated to inside the tailgate jamb, and a compressed air tank is mounted in the footwell. The rear cargo cover is sagging.",
      "The tilting custom steering wheel is worn and frames a 100-mph speedometer, a tachometer, and gauges for coolant temperature, fuel level, oil pressure, and battery voltage. An analog clock and readouts for the air springs are mounted in the center console. The six-digit odometer shows 2,400 miles and is believed to have rolled over. The Carfax report notes a mileage inconsistency in an October 2020 entry. Total mileage is unknown.",
      "The 5.0-liter V8 has been fitted with polished and chrome dress-up accessories along with a Powermaster alternator, an open-element air cleaner, and a custom pinstriped radiator shroud.",
      "Power is routed to the rear wheels through a four-speed 4L60 automatic transmission. Tubular headers are installed, and the catalytic converters have been removed.",
      "The Carfax report lists the aforementioned accident and mileage inconsistency."

      "This 2020 Rezvani Hercules is a custom pickup based on a Jeep Gladiator chassis that was converted to a 6×6 by Rezvani of Santa Ana, California. The truck is outfitted with fabricated body panels finished in matte black over black leather upholstery, and power is from a 6.4-liter SRT V8 mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission and a dual-range transfer case. Equipment includes body-color bumpers, a gold-finished roll bar, LED lighting, 20″ alloy wheels, power-operated side steps, Fox remote-reservoir shocks, a reverse-view camera, and an Alpine touchscreen infotainment system. First registered in California, the truck spent time in Montana, Florida, and Puerto Rico before it was acquired by the selling dealer in 2023. Previously listed on BaT in March 2024, this Rezvani Hercules has 8k miles and is now offered at no reserve with a clean Florida title listing it as a 2020 Jeep Gladiator.",
      "Assembled in Santa Ana, California, the Hercules was introduced in 2020 and is based on a Jeep Gladiator platform. This example is finished in matte black with body-color bumpers and gold chase-style bed bars. Details include an LED light bar, a bull bar, dual mirrors, a tailgate, and Rezvani badging.",
      "Gold-finished 20″ XD Rockstar II alloy wheels wear Rezvani-logo center caps and are mounted with 37×10.5″ Falken Wildpeak MT tires. Stopping power is from disc brakes, and the truck is equipped with a front and rear multi-link suspension setup, a rear anti-sway bar, and Fox DSC remote-reservoir adjustable shock absorbers.",
      "The front bucket seats and rear bench are upholstered in black leather with sueded inserts that extends to the door panels, center console, and dashboard. Additional features include Hercules script debossed on the headrests, a black sueded headliner, black carpets, a roll bar, a reverse-view camera, automatic climate control, an Alpine touchscreen infotainment system with navigation, and a custom audio system with supplementary overhead speakers.",
      "A multifunction leather-wrapped steering wheel sits ahead of a 120-mph speedometer, a 7k-rpm tachometer, a configurable digital display, and gauges for coolant temperature and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 8k miles.",
      "The 6.4-liter V8 sends power to the rear or all six wheels through an eight-speed automatic transmission and a dual-range transfer case.",
      "Additional underside photos can be viewed in the gallery below.",
      "The Carfax report lists no accidents or other damage, notes one manufacturer recall, and indicates that the truck was exported to Puerto Rico in 2022."

Equipment includes a 12-volt electrical system, 16″ black-finished steel wheels, a Klaxon horn, a wood tailgate and bed floor, a tow ball, a heater, and a replacement bench seat. This Power Wagon is offered by the seller on behalf of the current owner with a clean Colorado title in the owner’s name.",

      "This 1993 Chevrolet Corvette ZR-1 is powered by an LT5-based V8 that was modified by Lingenfelter Performance Engineering in 2016 to displace 415ci, and the powerplant is linked with a six-speed manual gearbox and a limited-slip differential. Finished in Ruby Red Metallic over matching leather upholstery, the car is equipped with 17″ sawblade alloy wheels, Van Steel front coilovers, a Stainless Works exhaust system, and two removable roof panels as well as pop-up headlights, power-adjustable sport seats, air conditioning, and a Delco Bose Gold Series sound system with CD and cassette players. Following registration history in Kentucky, New York, Nevada, and Colorado, the vehicle was acquired by the selling dealer in May 2024. With 24k miles, this modified Corvette ZR-1 is now offered in Pennsylvania with a window sticker, owner’s manuals, two keys, a Lingenfelter Certificate of Authenticity, spare parts, a roof-panel stand, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Colorado title.",
      "The C4 ZR-1 was sold between 1990 and 1995, and it featured a wider tail compared to the standard C4 Corvette and introduced a convex rear fascia with squared-off taillights. This example is finished in Ruby Red Metallic and features pop-up headlights, integrated fog lights, a removable transparent roof panel, front-fender vents, and power-adjustable and heated side mirrors. A body-color roof panel and a rolling stand are included in the sale.",
      "Staggered-width 17″ sawblade alloy wheels are mounted with 275/40 front and 315/35 rear Nitto NT555 RII tires that have 2020 and 2021 production-date codes. Braking is handled by an anti-lock disc at each corner. Van Steel adjustable coilovers have been fitted up front, and the matching uninstalled rears are included in the sale along with the removed Bilstein front shocks.",
      "The power-adjustable sport bucket seats are upholstered in Ruby Red leather with 40th Anniversary headrest embroidery. The door panels are trimmed to match, and additional appointments include air conditioning, an onboard computer, cruise control, a tire-pressure warning system, power windows and locks, and a Delco Bose Gold Series sound system with CD and cassette players.",
      "The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a central digital speedometer and fuel-level readout flanked by an analog tachometer and gauges for oil pressure, oil temperature, coolant temperature, and voltage. The digital odometer indicates 24k miles, approximately 100 of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The LT5-based 32-valve V8 was modified by Lingenfelter Performance Engineering (LPE) in 2016 with steel four-inch-bore cylinder liners, a larger throttle body, a stroker crankshaft, and custom pistons and connecting rods as well as ported and polished cylinder heads. The resultant displacement is 415c, and LPE rated the output at 610 horsepower.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed manual gearbox and a limited-slip differential. A Stainless Works exhaust system is in place.",
      "The window sticker lists initial delivery to Bob Smith Chevrolet in Louisville, Kentucky, factory colors and equipment, and a total suggested retail price of $67,478. A Lingenfelter Certificate of Authenticity notes their delivery date of October 26, 2016.",
      "The Carfax report is free of accident or damage entries."

A Rough Country 4″ suspension lift kit and dual-shock steering stabilizer have also been installed along with a revised power steering box, upgraded brakes, aftermarket front and rear bumpers, and more as detailed below. Finished in black over two-tone Medium Parchment leather, the truck is further equipped with 16″ polished alloy wheels, Warn manually locking front hubs, tow mirrors, and running boards as well as heated and power-adjustable front seats, automatic climate control, and a Boss touchscreen head unit. Acquired by the current owner in 2019, this modified turbodiesel Excursion has 275k miles and is now offered at no reserve on dealer consignment with manufacturer’s literature, a Haynes repair manual, a Deluxe Marti report, a Carfax report, and a clean Oregon title.",
      "The truck left the factory finished in Black Clearcoat and is believed to have been repainted during time with a previous owner. Aftermarket front and rear bumpers with LED lights, recovery hooks, and receiver hitches have been installed, and additional exterior details include an aftermarket vented hood, a brush guard, tinted glass, power-adjustable tow mirrors, running boards, rear parking sensors, and a split tailgate with a rear window wiper. The Carfax report contains a September 2010 entry that describes “minor damage” to the front of the truck, while “minor damage” to the left-rear area of the truck is recorded in a November 2019 entry. Blemishes noted by the selling dealer include imperfections in the window tinting film as well as dents on the hood, roof, and left side of the truck.",
      "Polished 16″ five-spoke alloy wheels are mounted with 285/75 Dean Back Country Mud Terrain tires. A Rough Country 4″ suspension lift kit comprised of front leaf springs, rear blocks, and six shocks has been installed along with a dual-shock steering stabilizer kit, an aftermarket power steering box, and upgraded sway bars. Braking is handled by upgraded red-finished calipers mounted over cross-drilled and slotted rotors at each wheel, and the truck is equipped with Warn manually locking front hubs. The tie rods and ball joints are said to have been replaced under current ownership.",
      "The heated and power-adjustable front captain’s chairs feature Limited embroidery on the backrests and are trimmed in two-tone Medium Parchment leather that extends to second- and third-row bench seats. Faux woodgrain trim accents the center console and door panels, and amenities include automatic climate control, cruise control, seat-position memory settings, power-adjustable pedals, and an overhead console with a trip computer, rear climate control knobs, and fold-down storage compartments. A Boss touchscreen head unit, a Uniden CB radio, and an electronic trailer brake controller have been installed. The overhead rear-seat DVD entertainment system is inoperative. Photos provided in the gallery show cracks and tears in the upholstery on the driver’s armrest, second-row bench, and both front seats.",
      "The leather-wrapped multifunction steering wheel frames a 100-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 3,500-rpm redline as well as gauges for oil pressure, transmission temperature, coolant temperature, and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 275k miles, approximately 90k of which were added by the current owner. The ABS warning light comes on intermittently.",
      "The 7.3-liter Power Stroke turbodiesel V8 has been fitted with 15-mode ECU tuning software as well as an in-cab touchscreen display that provides readouts and configurable settings for various engine-performance parameters. Additional modifications installed under current ownership include the following parts:",

      "Power is sent to the rear or all four wheels through a four-speed automatic transmission, an electronically shifted dual-range transfer case, and a limited-slip rear differential with 3.73:1 gearing. Modifications to the transmission include a triple-disc torque converter, an aftermarket pan, an upgraded oil cooler, and steel valve bodies.",
      "The Deluxe Marti report shows a build date of April 25, 2002, as well as initial delivery to Walnut Creek Ford of Walnut Creek, California and lists factory colors, equipment, and options alongside production statistics. Manufacturer’s literature and a Haynes repair manual are also included in the sale.",

      "This 1975 Honda GL1000 Gold Wing was reportedly refurbished circa 2015, and it was acquired by the seller in 2023. Refinished in blue with gold accents, the motorcycle is powered by a liquid-cooled 999cc SOHC flat-four mated to a five-speed transmission and an enclosed driveshaft. It is also equipped with an electric starter, a removable kick starter, four Keihin carburetors, a four-into-two exhaust system, an under-seat fuel tank, wire-spoke wheels, triple disc brakes, chrome-finished fenders, locking storage compartments, and both center and side stands. The battery and the fuel filter were changed in March 2024. This GL1000 is offered at no reserve with a clean California title in the seller’s name.",
      "The faux fuel tank, radiator shrouds, and side covers were reportedly refinished in blue with tri-color pinstripes and gold-tone badging as part of the refurbishment. The bike is equipped with a five-gallon fuel tank located beneath the two-up seat, and additional features include a rear grab bar, chrome-finished fenders, and both center and side stands.",
      "Wire-spoke wheels measuring 19″ up front and 17″ out back are mounted with Shinko and Dunlop tires, respectively. Suspension consists of an air-adjustable 37mm fork in addition to preload-adjustable shocks mounted to the swingarm on the left and the final drive enclosure on the right. Braking is from dual-piston calipers mounted over twin discs up front along with a single-piston caliper and a single disc out back.",
      "The chrome handlebar carries a pair of chrome-finished round mirrors, and it is mounted aft of a green-dial Nippon Seiki 150-mph speedometer, a matching tachometer with a faded 8,500-rpm redline and an inset coolant temperature gauge, and an indicator light panel containing the keyed ignition switch. The five-digit odometer shows 16k miles, approximately 500 of which were added by the seller.",
      "The liquid-cooled 999cc SOHC flat-four features an electric starter and a removable kick starter in addition to belt-driven camshafts, a counter-rotating alternator to offset crankshaft torque, and a black-finished four-into-two exhaust system with chrome shields and muffler tips. According to the seller, the carburetors were serviced, the timing belts were replaced, the valves were adjusted, and the fluids were changed as part of the refurbishment under previous ownership. Work in March 2024 is said to have included changing the battery, oil, and fuel filter.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheel through a five-speed transmission and a driveshaft enclosed within the right leg of the swingarm."

      "This 1965 Ford F-100 is a Flareside 4×4 pickup that was sold new in December 1964 from Clayt and Don Hill Limited in Canada. It underwent a cosmetic refurbishment in the 1990s under prior ownership that involved performing bodywork, installing fiberglass fenders, and repainting it in blue-green. The truck was later acquired by the seller in 2018 and is powered by a 300ci inline-six mated to a four-speed manual transmission and a dual-range transfer case. Further equipment includes 15″ steel wheels, Warn manually locking front hubs, drum brakes, chrome bumpers, and a wood bed floor with metal runners as well as a bench seat upholstered in white and green vinyl, vent windows, and a heater. This F-100 Flareside is now offered with manufacturer’s literature, shop manuals, spare parts, partial service records, and Ontario registration in the seller’s name.",
      "Finished from the factory in Twilight Turquoise (M), the truck was repainted as part of the aforementioned refurbishment under prior ownership. Fiberglass fenders have been fitted, and further details include a Flareside bed, dual side mirrors, chrome-finished bumpers, front tow hooks, and a wood bed floor with metal runners. Split boards in the bed along with paint chips on various body panels are noted.",
      "White-finished 15″ steel wheels are mounted with 31×10.5″ Kelly Safari MSR tires. The front axle is equipped with Warn manually locking hubs, and braking is handled by unassisted drums at all four corners.",
      "The bench seat was upholstered in white and green vinyl under prior ownership. A heater, vent windows, sun visors, and a rubberized floor covering are further details. The left vent window lock is not installed but is included in the sale.",
      "The four-spoke steering wheel frames a 100-mph speedometer and gauges for fuel level and coolant temperature. The five-digit odometer shows 75k miles, approximately 4k of which have been added under current ownership. Total mileage is unknown.",
      "The 300ci inline-six is equipped with a single carburetor and was factory rated at 170 horsepower and 283 lb-ft of torque. An oil leak is noted.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a four-speed manual transmission and a dual-range transfer case.",
      "Partially decoding the chassis tag shown above reveals the following information:",
      "The truck’s full chassis number is “6831020L4214481A”. The Ontario registration lists the VIN as “FL0214481”, and a redacted copy of the document is viewable in the gallery below.",
      "The truck does not have a title and is being sold on its Ontario registration, which serves as the ownership document in Ontario, Canada."

The bike remained with its second California owner for approximately 19 years before the seller acquired it in 2024. This XR650R is now offered at no reserve in California for off-road use only with a bill of sale.",
      "The red plastic bodywork wears black and yellow decals and is mounted over an aluminum frame. The bike is equipped with white front and side number plates as well as a 2.6-gallon fuel tank, a red and black vinyl solo seat, a skid plate, a headlight and taillight, spring-loaded serrated foot pegs, and a side stand. The seller notes scratches on the skid plate and plastics.",

Braking is handled by silver-finished calipers mounted over cross-drilled discs at both ends, while Kayaba adjustable suspension components consist of a 46mm leading-axle cartridge-type fork with black accordion gaiters as well as a remote-reservoir monoshock fitted to the box-section swingarm via a Pro-Link linkage. Blemishes are noted on the fork lowers.",
      "The silver-finished cross-braced handlebar is fitted with red plastic hand guards as well as clutch and compression-release levers on the left and a twist-grip throttle and brake lever on the right. A two-digit mechanical trip meter comprises the bike’s instrumentation, therefore true mileage is unknown.",
      "The liquid-cooled 649cc SOHC four-stroke single features a kick starter, a 42mm Keihin carburetor, CD ignition, and dual exhaust ports that feed into a black-finished high-mount exhaust system. The fluids were changed and the carburetor was cleaned in January 2024. Worn finish is visible on the engine covers.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheel through a multi-plate wet clutch, a five-speed transmission, and a drive chain. The drive chain and sprockets have been replaced, per the seller.",

It was acquired by the seller in 2023, and work has since involved the installation of a replacement four-speed manual transaxle, a rebuild of the carburetor, an overhaul of the brake system, a refresh of the fuel system, and replacement of the exhaust system and front floors. The car is powered by a replacement 602cc twin and is finished in Rouge Massena over red cloth. Equipment includes a black canvas top, 15″ steel wheels, and a cabin heater. This 2CV6 is now offered in Canada with the owner’s manual, service records, spare parts, and British Columbia registration.",
      "The car came finished in Rouge Massena (AC423) and was repainted in the late 1980s. Features include a black replacement canvas top, flip-up side windows, mudflaps, and round headlights. Safari-style bumper assemblies and fender extensions accompany the vehicle. Blemishes are pointed out by the seller in the gallery.",
      "The 15″ steel wheels are mounted with 135/15 Michelin tires. The drum brakes were overhauled in 2023, including replacement of the master cylinder, shoes, wheel cylinders, hoses, and lines.",
      "The front seats and rear bench are upholstered in red cloth, and interior appointments include front and rear seatbelts and a cabin heater.",
      "Instrumentation includes a speedometer and readouts for fuel level and amperage. The five-digit odometer shows 63k kilometers (~39k miles), approximately 1k of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The 602cc twin is equipped with a single carburetor that was rebuilt in 2023. Additional work at that time involved installing a replacement exhaust system, heater hoses, fuel tank, and fuel level sending unit.",
      "Power is sent to the front wheels through a four-speed manual transaxle, which was replaced in 2023. Replacement front floors were also installed at that time, and photos from the work are provided below.",
      "The vehicle is being sold on its British Columbia registration, which serves as the ownership document in British Columbia, Canada. The sale does not include a title."

Equipment includes trim, tinted windows, 19″ alloy wheels, carbon-ceramic disc brakes, parking sensors, a rearview camera, power-adjustable seats, automatic climate control, a pop-up infotainment screen, and navigation. The car was registered in Ohio and California and was acquired by the seller in August 2021, and it was listed on BaT in December 2022. This V12 Vantage S is offered by the seller in California with a clean Carfax report and an Ohio title.",
      "The car is finished in Snow White (AST5117H) and features a carbon-fiber front splitter, grille surround, hood and fender vents, and mirror caps. A carbon-fiber rear spoiler and front bumper cover canards were removed under current ownership. Additional equipment includes parking sensors, tinted windows, and dual exhaust outlets. Paint chips are noted on the front end.",
      "Staggered-width 19″ split-spoke wheels are mounted with Pirelli P Zero tires that were reportedly rotated in 2023. Stopping power is provided by yellow-finished calipers over carbon-ceramic rotors at all four corners. The car is equipped with an adaptive damping system with three selectable drive modes. A close-up photo of wheel blemishes is presented in the gallery below.",

      "The 5.9-liter V12 features quadruple overhead camshafts and was factory rated at 565 horsepower and 457 lb-ft of torque. A carbon-fiber engine cover is fitted. An oil change was performed and the wipers were replaced in January 2023. The car most recently passed a California emissions test in October 2018.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a seven-speed automated transaxle and a limited-slip differential.",
      "The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage, and it indicates that a duplicate Ohio title was issued in February 2022. There is currently a lien on the car, and the seller’s lender will need to be paid before the title can be transferred to the next owner.",
      "The vehicle is fitted with a temporary Ohio tag that expired in October 2021."

Purchased by its current owner in April 2017, this F355 Berlinetta is now offered on dealer consignment with a tool kit, a clean Carfax report, and a Florida title",
      "The Pininfarina-designed body is finished in Rosso Corsa, and styling elements include pop-up headlights, integrated front fog lights, an integrated rear decklid spoiler, quad exhaust outlets, a vented engine cover, and air intakes on the doors and rocker panels. According to the selling dealer, cracks on the buttresses have been repaired, and the front bumper cover has been repainted. Clear paint-protection film has reportedly been applied to the body.",

The six-digit odometer shows 26k miles, approximately 6k of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The mid-mounted 3.5-liter DOHC V8 features five valves per cylinder and dry-sump lubrication for a factory-rated output of 375 horsepower and 268 lb-ft of torque.

      "This 1995 Land Rover Defender 110 is a three-door left-hand-drive station wagon that was registered in France before it was cosmetically and mechanically refurbished in 2022 by Invicta Automotive Design of Manchester, England. The project involved repairing and refinishing the body and chassis, converting the roof to an Exmoor Trim soft top, and refreshing the interior in addition to overhauling the 2.5-liter 300Tdi turbodiesel inline-four, R380 5-speed manual transmission, four-wheel disc brakes, and suspension. The truck features a locking center differential, 18″ alloy wheels, inward-facing rear jump seats, Focal speakers, a Bluetooth-capable Alpine stereo, and a MOMO steering wheel. Imported to the US in December 2022, this 110 was acquired by its current owner in October 2023, and it is now offered on their behalf by the seller in Colorado with a BMIHT certificate, a commemorative book, and a clean Illinois title in the owner’s name.",
      "The aluminum body was disassembled, repaired, and equipped with a heavy-duty soft top frame, a Puma-style hood and doors, and replacement glass, weatherstripping, hardware, and galvanized trim before the truck was refinished in Keswick Green. The frame was also media blasted, repaired, and powder-coated during the refurbishment. An Exmoor Trim PVC soft top, LED exterior lighting, an Invicta-branded sump guard, and backlit aluminum door handles are additional elements.",
      "Finished in satin black, Lucari Solutions 18″ XTR-1 alloy wheels are wrapped in 265/60 BFGoodrich Mud-Terrain T/A KM3 tires, and a matching spare is mounted on an ORE swing-away carrier. The four-wheel disc brakes have ventilated front rotors and silver-finished calipers at each corner.",
      "High-back bucket seats with adjustable headrests are trimmed in Ivory Nappa leather. A locking Exmoor Trim center console is fitted, and molded all-weather mats line the floors. Focal speakers are linked with a Bluetooth-capable Alpine stereo with a USB port.",
      "A MOMO Indy steering wheel fronts a recovered dashboard and replacement instruments, and the shifters have polished aluminum knobs. The six-digit odometer shows 1,600 miles traveled since completion of the project. Total mileage is unknown.",
      "Inward-facing rear benches are installed over synthetic teak-style flooring in the cargo area, and the seller reports that seatbelts for eight passengers are fitted.",
      "The overhauled 2.5-liter 300Tdi turbodiesel inline-four is mated to an R380 five-speed manual transmission that was reconditioned by Hallbeck Engineering of Wrexham, Wales. A dual-range transfer case and a locking center differential complete the powertrain. A replacement fuel tank and wiring are also noted.",
      "Underbody condition is shown further in the gallery below.",
      "A British Motor Industry Heritage Trust certificate lists factory colors, equipment, identification numbers, and delivery from the factory to Land Rover France SAS.",
      "Additional photos from the refurbishment process are shown at the end of the gallery.",
      "The Carfax report has a pair of entries that list history in Florida beginning in December 2022.",
      "The photos in the gallery were taken in 2023 before the truck was relocated to Colorado."

      "This 1943 Ford GPW was refurbished in the mid-2010s under prior ownership by Hammon’s Garage of Fort Worth, Texas, not long before being acquired by the current owner in May 2019. The vehicle is finished in gray with a gray soft top over gray upholstery, and U.S. Navy lettering adorns various body panels. Power is supplied by a 134ci L-head inline-four paired with a three-speed manual transmission and a dual-range transfer case. Features include 16″ steel wheels, a nine-slot grille, a fold-down windshield, manual windshield wipers, a side-exit exhaust system, a rear-mounted jerrycan, a side-mounted shovel and ax, occupant-retention straps, and a keyed ignition. This GPW is now offered on dealer consignment with refurbishment and service records as well as a Pennsylvania title in the owner’s name.",
      "Commissioned by the United States government in October 1941, the Ford GPW was built to help meet demand for the newly introduced Willys MB military vehicle. Approximately 280,000 examples were manufactured at several Ford plants during World War II. This GPW has been repainted in gray and bears black stencil graphics referencing the U.S. Navy. A canvas top with two bows has been fitted along with a shovel, an ax, a jerrycan, and grab handles.",
      "Military-style steel wheels wear 6.00-16 Ford Motor Company–branded tires, and a matching spare is attached at the rear. Braking is handled by four-wheel drums.",
      "The open interior houses individual front seats and a rear bench trimmed in gray cloth, while the floors are covered in matching paint. Appointments include occupant-retention straps, instructional placards, a glove compartment, and rear storage cubbies. The push-button starter was replaced with a keyed ignition under prior ownership.",
      "A three-spoke steering wheel sits ahead of a 60-mph speedometer and gauges for fuel level, oil pressure, coolant temperature, and amperage. The five-digit odometer shows less than 200 miles, with actual mileage unknown.",
      "The carbureted 134ci Go-Devil L-head inline-four features a downdraft carburetor and operates in conjunction with a six-volt electrical system. The battery was replaced in 2019, and the points and condenser were replaced in 2020.",
      "A three-speed manual transmission routes power to the rear or all four wheels through a dual-range transfer case. The clutch was freed up in September 2023.",
      "The Pennsylvania title carries an “Antique” brand."

It was optioned with a Hi-Fi sound system, power-adjustable seats, and a leather-trimmed headliner and rear parcel shelf. Additional equipment includes an electronically controlled limited-slip differential, 19″ split-spoke alloy wheels, cross-drilled brake rotors, carbon-fiber interior trim, and automatic climate control. Acquired by the current owner on BaT in October 2019, this F430 has just over 8,500 miles and is offered on dealer consignment in Utah with an owner’s manual, a luggage set, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Montana title.",
      "The Pininfarina-designed body is finished in Rosso Corsa and features xenon headlights, heated side mirrors, and quad exhaust tips exiting on either side of the rear diffuser.",
      "The 19″ split-spoke alloy wheels are mounted with Continental ExtremeContact DW Tuned tires. Stopping power is provided by black-finished brake calipers over cross-drilled and ventilated rotors.",
      "Beige Tradizione leather covers the power-adjustable bucket seats and extends to the center console, headliner, rear parcel shelf, and door panels. Amenities include air conditioning, drilled aluminum pedals, and a Hi-Fi sound system with a subwoofer. Cavallino Rampante-embossed headrests and carbon-fiber trim are additional appointments.",
      "The three-spoke steering wheel is equipped with an engine-start button as well as a manettino dial for control of dynamic settings. Instrumentation includes a central tachometer with an 8,500-rpm redline as well as a 220-mph speedometer and gauges for coolant temperature, oil temperature, and oil pressure. The digital odometer indicates just over 8,500 miles, a handful of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The mid-mounted 4.3-liter F136 V8 features Bosch Motronic engine management and a dry-sump lubrication system. Factory-rated output was 483 horsepower and 343 lb-ft of torque, which is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed manual transaxle and an electronically controlled limited-slip differential. An oil change was carried out in preparation for the sale.",
      "Ferrari-branded luggage will accompany the car.",
      "The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage."

      "This 1969 Plymouth GTX hardtop underwent a custom build under prior ownership in 2010 by Trans Am Specialties of Florida, and it is powered by an SRT-10 Viper-sourced 8.3-liter V10 that is fitted with a Paxton Novi supercharger and mated to a six-speed manual transmission. Finished in blue with a black vinyl roof, the car is also equipped with black Viper-sourced seats, Stewart-Warner gauges, a Pioneer Bluetooth head unit, air conditioning, Wilwood cross-drilled disc brakes, coilover suspension, and MagnaFlow mufflers. This modified GTX was acquired by the selling dealer in 2023 and is now offered with a clean Florida title.",
      "The car was repainted blue as part of the 2010 build and features a black vinyl roof, a bright grille, quad HID headlights, chrome bumpers, GTX and Viper badging, dual side mirrors, and dual exhaust outlets.",
      "Aftermarket 18″ wheels are mounted with Michelin tires. Wilwood cross-drilled disc brakes have been added with six-piston calipers up front. Other details include a Magnum Force four-link suspension and coilovers all around.",
      "The front bucket seats were sourced from a Dodge Viper and are trimmed in black leather with microfiber inserts. Amenities include a Pioneer Bluetooth stereo, a custom sound system, Viper-branded floor mats, a custom shift knob, and air conditioning.",
      "The dashboard has been replaced and hosts rocker switches and Stewart-Warner gauges including a 160-mph speedometer and 8k-rpm tachometer. The six-digit odometer shows 10,500 miles, and true chassis mileage is unknown.",
      "The 8.3-liter V10 was sourced from an SRT-10 Viper and has been fitted with a Paxton Novi supercharger. Other features include a methanol injection system as well as various cooling and fuel system upgrades. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a six-speed manual transmission also sourced from the donor Viper. A Dana 60 rear axle is said to be fitted. The custom exhaust features tubular headers and MagnaFlow mufflers.",
      "Several photos of the build process have been provided by the selling dealer, who notes that the chassis was reinforced during the build."

      "This 1998 Dodge Viper GTS is #47 of 100 GT2 Championship Edition coupes built during a single model year to commemorate Chrysler’s winning of the 1997 FIA GT2 championship and a class victory in the 1998 24 Hours of Le Mans. The current owner purchased the car new and it now has 3,600 miles. It is powered by an 8.0-liter V10 paired with a six-speed manual transmission and is finished in Stone White Clearcoat with blue stripes over black and blue leather. The car is equipped with a limited-slip differential, 18″ BBS wheels, and projector-style headlights. This Viper GT2 is now offered on dealer consignment with manufacturer’s literature, a car cover, two model cars, an accident-free Carfax report ,and a clean New York title.",
      "Championship Edition models received GTS-R badging along with a factory aero package including a front splitter, ground-effect side skirts, and a fixed rear wing. The Stone White Clearcoat body features blue stripes, and other exterior details comprise projector-style headlights, fog lights, a vented hood, and dual center-exit exhaust outlets. The rear hatch struts were replaced in preparation for the sale.",
      "The 18″ BBS alloy wheels are mounted with Michelin Pilot SX tires measuring 275/35 up front and 335/30 out back. The right-rear wheel has curb marks. Braking is handled by four-wheel ventilated discs, and a brake fluid flush was performed in June 2024.",
      "The cabin features bucket seats upholstered in black leather with blue inserts along with a color-coordinated dashboard, center console, door panels, and handbrake handle. Additional equipment includes Oreca racing harnesses, adjustable pedals, power windows, and dual airbags.",
      "A plaque affixed to the gear selector surround indicates this as chassis #47 of Championship Edition examples built.",
      "The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a 200-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 6k-rpm redline. Auxiliary gauges for coolant temperature, oil pressure, fuel level, and voltage are mounted atop the center stack. The six-digit odometer shows 3,600 miles.",
      "The 8.0-liter OHV V10 features a low-restriction air cleaner and was factory rated at 460 horsepower and 500 lb-ft of torque in GT2 Championship specification. The oil was changed in preparation for the sale.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a Tremec T-56 six-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential.",

Features include a power antenna, front and rear spoilers, fog lights, power-adjustable side mirrors, and dual exhaust outlets. Scratches and door dings are present, and the bumper paint has faded.",

      "This 1968 Ford Thunderbird was reportedly sold new in Pennsylvania and remained with its first owner until 2003, and it was relocated to Ontario, Canada, under current ownership. Powered by a 429ci “Thunder Jet” V8 paired with a three-speed automatic transmission, the car has been refinished in green over black vinyl upholstery. It also features a black vinyl roof, hideaway headlights, sequential taillights, 15″ wheels, air conditioning, crank windows, and a Philco AM radio. This Thunderbird shows 27k miles and is offered on dealer consignment in Ontario, Canada, with Ontario registration.",
      "The car left the factory finished in Highland Green (R), and the selling dealer states that it was repainted under current ownership. Exterior details include a driver-side mirror, sequential taillights, and a black “Alligator-Grain” vinyl roof with landau bars. The vacuum system for the hideaway headlights was reportedly rebuilt under current ownership.",
      "The 15″ wheels are mounted with 215/75 Goodyear Assurance All-Season front tires and Futura 855 rear tires. Stopping power is provided by power-assisted front disc brakes and rear drum brakes. The selling dealer states that the braking and power-steering systems were overhauled and the suspension bushings were replaced under current ownership.",
      "The front bucket seats and the rear bench seat are trimmed in black vinyl. Appointments include air conditioning, crank windows, and a Philco AM radio.",
      "The two-spoke steering wheel sits ahead of a woodgrain-trimmed instrument panel, which contains a 120-mph speedometer, a clock, and auxiliary gauges. The five-digit mechanical odometer shows 27k miles, approximately 10k of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The 429ci “Thunder Jet” V8 is equipped with a four-barrel carburetor and produced 360 horsepower when new. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a three-speed automatic transmission that was reportedly rebuilt under current ownership, and additional service is said to have involved adjusting the valves and replacing the radiator.",
      "According to the selling dealer, the fuel tank and the dual exhaust system have been replaced. Photos show corrosion on various underbody components.",
      "The vehicle does not have a title and is being sold on its Ontario registration, which serves as the ownership document in Ontario, Canada."

      "This 2006 Mini Cooper S convertible was first delivered to Rasmussen Mini in Portland, Oregon. It was purchased new by the seller, and it has 76k miles following registration history in Washington. Finished in Pure Silver Metallic with black hood stripes over black leatherette, the car is powered by a supercharged 1.6-liter inline-four paired with a six-speed manual transaxle. The car is equipped with a black soft top, 16″ seven-spoke alloy wheels, grille-mounted auxiliary lights, heated front seats, a CD stereo, and air conditioning. This R52 Cooper S convertible is now offered at no reserve with a window sticker, the owner’s manual, and a clean Washington title in the seller’s name.",
      "The car is finished in Pure Silver Metallic with black hood stripes and features fog lights, grille-mounted auxiliary lights, heated mirrors, a hood scoop, and twin center-exit exhaust outlets. The Carfax report indicates that an accident involving another vehicle occurred in January 2007. A bumper cover was subsequently repaired, per the seller. The replacement power-retractable black convertible soft top is said to have been fitted in 2023, and it features a heated glass rear window. Imperfections are noted on the hood.",
      "The 16″ seven-spoke wheels are mounted with Bridgestone DriveGuard tires, which show date codes from 2017. Curb marks are noted. The car is equipped with a sport suspension. The front-left wheel bearing and front brake rotors and pads were reportedly replaced in 2020.",
      "The cabin features seating surfaces upholstered in black leatherette. Equipment includes heated front seats, CD stereo, and air conditioning. The reverse sensor alert does not work.",
      "The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a column-mounted 8k-rpm tachometer. A 150-mph speedometer with integrated fuel-level and coolant temperature gauges are mounted in the center of the dashboard. The digital odometer indicates 76k miles.",
      "The supercharged 1.6-liter inline-four was factory rated at 168 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque. The seller notes that the spark plugs were replaced in 2023, and the coolant overflow tank was replaced earlier this year.",
      "Power is sent to the front wheels through a Getrag six-speed manual transaxle.",
      "The window sticker lists initial delivery to Rasmussen Mini in Portland, Oregon, along with factory equipment, colors, and a total suggested retail price of $26,500.",

      "This 2024 Tesla Cybertruck AWD is a Foundation Series example with laser-etched badging, white interior trim, and Full Self-Driving capability. A dual-motor AWD model, it features stainless-steel bodywork, variable-ratio four-wheel steering, adaptive air suspension, 20″ Cyber wheels, heated and ventilated front seats trimmed in black Premium upholstery, front and rear touchscreens, and eight exterior cameras. The current owner purchased the truck new and has since added approximately 674 miles. This Cybertruck AWD Foundation Series is now offered with a charging cable, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Missouri title.",
      "The Cybertruck is built with stainless-steel body panels and a unibody architecture comprised of a structural battery pack, high-strength steel, and cast aluminum subframes. This example has Foundation Series badging in addition to a power-operated front trunk, eight exterior cameras, automatic LED lighting, eight anchor points for accessories, and a full-length roof panel that is constructed with impact-resistant acoustic glass.",
      "The composite 6′ cargo box has a storage compartment below the floor as well as LED light bars, 120- and 240-volt power outlets, and an L-track system. Buttons on the left-rear corner operate the tailgate release and the tonneau cover, which retracts into the forward bulkhead. Cargo and towing capacities are rated at 2,500 and 11,000 pounds, respectively.",
      "The truck’s high-voltage lithium-ion battery sends power to all four wheels through a front induction motor and an AC permanent-magnet synchronous motor at the rear. The powertrain is factory rated at 593 horsepower and 525 lb-ft of torque, and maximum range is an estimated 340 miles. The variable-ratio steer-by-wire system requires less than one full turn from lock to lock, and the four-wheel disc brakes work in tandem with a regenerative braking system. Electronic stability and traction control are also provided, and the truck rides on adaptive air suspension and 20″ Cyber alloy wheels with 285/65 Goodyear Wrangler Territory RT tires.",
      "The heated and ventilated front seats are trimmed in black Premium upholstery with white piping, and the Foundation Series specified white accents on the dashboard and door panel inserts. Other appointments include an 18.5″ front touchscreen, a 9.4” rear touchscreen, a 15-speaker sound system, heated rear seats, wireless charging pads, USB ports, and 110-volt power outlets.",
      "The oblong steering wheel has buttons and scroll wheels instead of control stalks. The driver is aided by Full Self-Driving capability, automatic emergency braking, pedestrian detection, emergency lane departure avoidance, and eight exterior cameras. The digital odometer indicates 674 miles.",
      "The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage."

      "This 1953 BMW R67/2 was acquired by the seller in 2001, and a subsequent eight-month refurbishment performed by Bench Mark Works of Sturgis, Mississippi, was completed in 2003 and included rebuilds of its 594cc opposed twin, four-speed transmission, and final drive as well as a repaint in black with white pinstriping. The bike is equipped with a driveshaft, a Pagusa solo saddle, a luggage rack, a hinged rear fender, a toolbox integrated atop the fuel tank, a pair of Bing carburetors, a magneto ignition system, a kick starter, and a chrome dual exhaust system with low-slung torpedo-style mufflers. This R67/2 is now offered with owner’s and repair manuals, a tool roll, refurbishment and service records, a BMW Mobile Tradition certificate, and a clean Michigan title in the seller’s name.",
      "The bike was refinished in black with white pinstriping during the refurbishment, and it features a 4.4-gallon fuel tank with black rubber knee grips and an integrated locking toolbox. The black rubber Pagusa solo saddle is adjustable for spring tension and height. Additional equipment includes a headlight, a brake light, a rear luggage rack, a center stand, and valanced fenders, the front of which features a lower stay that doubles as a front-wheel stand and the rear of which is hinged.",
      "Interchangeable 19″ wire-spoke wheels are finished in black with silver center stripes and mounted with Heidenau K34 tires showing 2020 date codes. Suspension is handled by a conventional telescopic fork with black accordion gaiters up front as well as a pair of shrouded plunger shocks out back. Stopping power is provided by 200mm drum brakes with twin leading shoes up front and a single leading-shoe at the rear.",
      "A chrome handlebar equipped with Magura grips and a mirror is clamped by pullback risers that frame the key-handle adjustment knob for a friction-plate damper in the steering stem. Instrumentation consists of a Veigel 120-mph speedometer and a trio of indicator lamps inset atop the headlight bucket. The five-digit odometer shows 12k miles ridden since completion of the refurbishment, though true mileage is unknown.",
      "The 594cc opposed twin was factory rated at 28 horsepower and is equipped with a pair of 24mm Bing carburetors, a six-volt magneto ignition system, and a kick starter. The chrome low-mounted dual exhaust system features a balance pipe and torpedo-style mufflers. Service in 2023 included adjusting the valves, balancing the carburetors, and changing the oil.",
      "The number 614201  stamped on the engine case matches the numbers stamped on the steering head plate and the left shock mount, photos of which can be viewed in the gallery.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheel through a single-plate dry clutch and a rebuilt four-speed transmission with an auxiliary hand shifter as well as an exposed driveshaft. The rebuilt final drive carries a 32/9 ratio according to the stamp on its housing.",
      "The BMW Mobile Tradition certificate shows the bike as being manufactured in May 1953 and delivered to the V Harasty Corporation of Whitestone, Long Island, New York, in June of that year. Additional data includes the factory color as well as the chassis and engine serial numbers, and photos of the stampings can be viewed in the gallery.",
      "The bike is accompanied by owner’s and repair manuals, refurbishment and service records, and a tool roll."

      "This 2009 Mercedes-Benz SL65 AMG has 26k miles, and it has spent most of its time registered in Texas and Arizona.

Equipment includes a power-retractable hardtop, a panoramic glass roof, bi-xenon headlights, 19″ AMG split-spoke wheels, Active Body Control suspension, Keyless Go, heated and ventilated multi-contour seats, the Airscarf system, and COMAND infotainment with navigation. This R230 was previously offered by the selling dealer on BaT in May 2024 and is now offered at no reserve with the owner’s manuals, service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Pennsylvania title.",
      "The car is finished in Iridium Silver Metallic (775) and features a power-folding convertible hardtop with a panoramic glass roof. Other equipment includes bi-xenon headlights with cornering illumination along with fog lights, fender air vents, and AMG bodywork consisting of a revised front spoiler, side skirts, and quad exhaust outlets. A ceramic coating was applied to the body in October 2022, at which time clear paint-protection film was applied to the nose.",
      "Split-spoke 19″ AMG wheels are mounted with Continental ExtremeContact tires. The car features Active Body Control (ABC) suspension as well as an Electronic Stability Program (ESP), Automatic Slip Regulation (ASR), and an AMG High Performance Braking System with drilled and slotted rotors. The power steering and suspension fluids were flushed in August 2022, at which time the brake fluid was changed. The tire pressure monitor sensors were replaced in September 2022.",
      "The heated, ventilated, and massaging power-adjustable multi-contour seats are upholstered in red leather with diamond-stitched inserts. Amenities include the Airscarf neck-warming system, burl walnut veneers, dual-zone automatic climate control, cruise control, a wind deflector, Keyless Go, and COMAND with navigation.",
      "The leather-trimmed steering wheel frames a 220-mph speedometer, a 7k-rpm tachometer, and gauges for coolant temperature and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 26k miles.",
      "The twin-turbocharged 6.0-liter M275 V12 was factory rated at 604 horsepower and 738 lb-ft of torque. Work in September 2022 included replacing the air filter, cabin filter, fuel filter, and spark plugs, while the thermostat and fuel pump were replaced in February 2023. The oil was changed in June 2023.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a five-speed automatic transmission. The transmission fluid was flushed in August 2022.",

      "This 1988 Porsche 911 Carrera coupe is powered by a 3.2-liter flat-six paired with a G50 five-speed manual transaxle and is finished in Marine Blue Metallic over blue leather. Equipment includes a high-performance ECU chip, a high-flow air filter, a Fabspeed Maxflo exhaust system, sport suspension, 16″ Fuchs alloy wheels, a power sunroof, a rear spoiler, power-adjustable front seats, air conditioning, and a Blaupunkt cassette stereo. The selling dealer purchased the car in 2024 and subsequent work consisted of servicing the engine, overhauling the brakes, replacing the rear window trim, and removing an aftermarket alarm system. This Carrera coupe shows 142k miles and is offered by the selling dealer in North Carolina with an owner’s manual, service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Virginia title.",
      "The car is finished in Marine Blue Metallic and features fog lights, heated power-adjustable side mirrors, a power sunroof, a rear spoiler, and dual exhaust outlets with polished finishers. Blemishes in the paint are noted on the roof, right fender, and right quarter panel, and paint meter readings from around the car are presented in the gallery.  The rear glass window frame was replaced under current ownership.",
      "The 16″ Fuchs alloy wheels are mounted with 205/55 front and 225/50 rear Continental DWS tires. The car was optioned with sport shocks, and braking is handled by four-wheel discs. The wheel bearings, brake rotors, and brake pads were replaced in preparation for the sale.",
      "The power-adjustable front seats and individual rear seats are upholstered in blue leather with white piping. Appointments include air conditioning, cruise control, power windows and locks, a wood shift knob, and a Blaupunkt cassette stereo. An aftermarket alarm system was removed under current ownership.",
      "The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames VDO instrumentation including a central tachometer with a 6,300-rpm redline as well as a 170-mph speedometer, a Quarz clock, and gauges for oil level, oil pressure, oil temperature, and fuel level. The six-digit odometer shows 142k miles. The horn contact plate was replaced in preparation for the sale.",
      "The 3.2-liter M930/25 flat-six features Bosch Motronic engine management with a performance ECU chip as well as a conical high-performance air filter and a Fabspeed Maxflo exhaust system with a Euro-style pre-muffler pipe. The catalytic converter has been removed. A top-end rebuild was completed in 2010 at ~110k miles, and work in preparation for the sale consisted of replacing the crankshaft sensors and spark plugs and changing the oil.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a G50 five-speed manual transaxle. The clutch assembly was replaced in September 2010, and the left outer axle boot was replaced in March 2024.",
      "The Carfax report shows no accidents or other damage and lists history in New York, Georgia, and Virginia",

      "This Porsche 356 Speedster replica was reportedly assembled by Vintage Speedsters of Hawaiian Gardens, California, and was acquired by the current owner in July 2010. Powered by an air-cooled 1.6L flat-four paired with a four-speed manual transaxle, the car is finished in silver over black vinyl upholstery. Equipment includes 15″ chrome steel wheels, front disc brakes, and a black convertible soft top, boot cover, and side curtains in addition to a rear luggage rack, a banjo-style steering wheel, a Kenwood CD stereo, lap belts, dual carburetors, and a GT-style exhaust. This Speedster replica is now offered by the seller with a repair manual and a Florida title in the current owner’s name listing it as a 1968 Volkswagen.",
      "The fiberglass body is finished in silver and fitted over a modified Volkswagen Beetle chassis. Exterior details include a black convertible soft top, boot cover, and side curtains as well as chrome headlight grilles, teardrop taillights, a single grille decklid, a luggage rack, gold-finished Porsche and 1600 Super badging, a reproduction Reutter badge on the right fender, and body-color bumpers with chrome overriders and rub strips.",
      "Chrome 15″ steel wheels wear matching hubcaps and are mounted with 165-series Kelly Metric Radial tires. Stopping is provided by front disc and rear drum brakes.",
      "The fixed-back bucket seats are trimmed in black vinyl upholstery, which extends to the dashboard pad, door panels, rear parcel shelf, and shifter and parking brake boots. Additional interior elements include black square-weave carpeting, Porsche Speedster-branded floor mats, a cabin heater, and an adjustable height rearview mirror, and a Kenwood CD stereo linked to speakers in the door panels.",
      "The banjo-style steering wheel wears a Porsche-crest horn button and frames a central tachometer flanked by a 130-mph speedometer and a combination gauge for fuel level and oil temperature. The five-digit mechanical odometer shows 3k miles, approximately 2k of which have been added under current ownership.",
      "The air-cooled 1.6L flat-four features dual carburetors, Scat air cleaner covers, a Bosch blue coil, PerTronix electronic ignition, and a GT-style muffler with heater boxes.",
      "Power is delivered to the rear wheels through a four-speed manual transaxle.",
      "The chassis number 118095905 shown above is consistent with a 1968 Volkswagen Beetle and matches the VIN on the current Florida title."

      "This 2005 Honda Rune is a limited-production motorcycle based on the contemporary Valkyrie and it was purchased new by an uncle of the seller, who acquired the bike in 2023. Finished in Bloodstone Red Metallic with chrome accents, it is powered by a 1,832cc SOHC flat-six mated to a five-speed transmission and an enclosed driveshaft. Equipment includes a digital instrument display, an ignition immobilizer, LED taillights, a black solo seat, a trailing-link fork, and a Unit Pro-Link linkage and monoshock along with a single-sided swingarm, chrome-plated 18″ and 17″ alloy wheels, triple Nissin disc brakes, electronic fuel injection, and a six-into-two exhaust system. This Rune has 2k miles and is now offered with two keys, a service record, and a clean Ohio title in the seller’s name.",
      "The bike is finished in Bloodstone Red Metallic and features an aluminum twin-spar frame, a black solo seat, a 6.1-gallon fuel tank, a chrome engine guard, and a side stand. The lighting package is comprised of dual headlights housed in a triangular color-keyed bucket with a chrome visor in addition to chrome turn signals and a pair of vertical LED taillight strips incorporated into the rear fender. Photos showing a scratch on the rear fender are provided in the gallery below. The seller notes the bike has been ceramic coated and there are chrome imperfections on the right engine cover and foot peg.",
      "Five-spoke aluminum wheels measuring 18″ up front and 17″ out back wear Dunlop D251 tires, and suspension consists of a chrome trailing-link fork along with a single-sided swingarm attached to a Unit Pro-Link linkage and remote-reservoir monoshock. Braking is handled by dual Nissin three-piston calipers mounted over cross-drilled rotors up front as well as a two-piston Nissin caliper and a cross-drilled rotor at the rear.",
      "The tubular chrome handlebar carries matching controls, grips, and mirrors. A digital screen housed in a chrome console atop the fuel tank displays a speedometer, a fuel-level readout, and a pair of trip meters. The digital odometer indicates 2k miles, approximately 150 of which were ridden under current ownership. The bike is equipped with the Honda Ignition Security System (HISS), which engages the immobilizer and steering lock when the key is removed.",
      "The liquid-cooled 1,832cc SOHC flat-six features two valves per cylinder, electronic fuel injection, and a chrome six-into-two exhaust system. Factory-rated output was 118 horsepower and 120 lb-ft of torque. The PGM-FI unit was replaced in 2021, and replacement keys were cut and programmed at that time. The most recent oil change was reportedly carried out within the last 50 miles.",
      "Power is transferred to the rear wheel through a hydraulically actuated clutch, a five-speed transmission, and a driveshaft enclosed within the swingarm."

      "This 1957 Volkswagen Karmann Ghia coupe was acquired as a disassembled project in 2017 by the seller, who initiated a refurbishment that was completed in 2019. Work included rebuilding rust remediation, repainting the body in Gazelle Beige, reupholstering the interior in copper red and brown upholstery, and overhauling the suspension and brake systems. Additionally, the air-cooled flat-four was modified to displace 1,395cc by fitting 69.5mm crankshaft and 80mm pistons and cylinders in addition to Okrasa-style dual-port cylinder heads, an Okrasa-specification camshaft, a Hengst cartridge-style oil filter, Dual Solex 32 PBIC carburetors, and Knecht air filters. More details regarding the refurbishment can be found via the seller’s forum thread here. This Karmann Ghia coupe is now offered with a clean California title in the seller’s name.",
      "The car was disassembled and received replacement floor pans under previous ownership before undergoing further refurbishment by the seller. Work included performing rust remediation and priming the body before applying four coats of Gazelle Beige (L376) using single-stage Acrylic Urethane paint, per the seller. The headlight rings were re-chromed and stainless steel reproduction bumpers have been installed along with replacement seals and gaskets. Additional exterior details include dual side-view mirrors, pop-out rear quarter windows, and dual “pea shooter” exhaust outlets.",
      "Steel 15″ wheels wear re-chromed VW-stamped hubcaps and are mounted with 165-series Firestone F-560 tires. The spindles were rebuilt and the shocks, tie rod ends, and steering damper were replaced in addition to the brake lines, master cylinder, and wheel cylinders as part of the refurbishment.",
      "Said to have been refurbished with materials ordered from Germany, the interior features thin back bucket seats, a folding rear bench, and door panels are trimmed in copper red vinyl with white piping and brown corduroy inserts in addition to German square-weave carpets, a rubber floor mat, and a wool headliner. The doors do not lock and the horn is inoperative.",
      "The refurbished two-spoke steering wheel wears a Wolfsburg crest horn button and fronts a 90-mph VDO speedometer and an ISP West tachometer. The five-digit mechanical odometer shows 4,400 miles, which is said to represent the distance traveled since the completion of the refurbishment. True mileage is unknown.",
      "The air-cooled flat-four engine has been modified to displace 1,397cc by installing a 69.5mm crankshaft and 80mm pistons and cylinders in addition to the following:",

      "This 1966 Ford Mustang convertible was acquired by the seller’s spouse in 1976, and work in the early 2000s included a repaint, re-covered front seats, a rebuild of the three-speed manual transmission, repairs of the floors, and the installation of a replacement rebuilt 289ci V8. The car is finished in red over black vinyl and features a black soft top, 14″ steel wheels with covers, front bucket seats, a cassette radio, and a cabin heater. This Mustang is now offered with the owner’s manual, service records, a car cover, and a clean Delaware title in the names of the seller and their spouse.",
      "The car was delivered from the factory in Candy Apple Red and was repainted in 2003, at which time the left rear quarter panel was replaced and a replacement windshield, chrome bumpers, and soft top were installed. The seller notes several repaired holes in the soft top and states that the top requires two people to fully secure.",
      "The 14″ steel wheels wear covers and are mounted with 195/75 Uniroyal Tiger Paw tires that were installed in 2020. Braking is handled by front and rear drums.",
      "The cabin features front bucket seats and a rear bench trimmed in black vinyl and equipped with lap belts. The front seats were reupholstered in 2001, at which time the carpets and dash pad were replaced and a cassette radio was installed. The seller notes the rear windows do not raise and the parking brake handle is cracked. Seam separation on the rear bench is shown up close in the gallery.",
      "The three-spoke steering wheel frames a 140-mph speedometer and gauges for fuel level, oil pressure, amperage, and coolant temperature. The five-digit odometer has rolled over and shows 44k miles.",
      "The replacement 289ci V8 was rebuilt and installed in 2001, at which time a replacement clutch and alternator were installed.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a three-speed manual transmission and a rear axle with 2.80:1 gears. The front frame was repaired and the floors, battery apron, and torque boxes were replaced in 2000, and photos from the work are provided at the end of the gallery. There are rust holes in the muffler.",
      "The warranty number is consistent with a 1966 Mustang convertible that was built in Metuchen, New Jersey and equipped with a 289ci V8. Decoding the trim tag reveals the following information:"

This one is finished in a drab camouflage paint scheme and equipped with a detachable hydraulically operated front-end loader in addition to a rear-mounted backhoe that folds onto the back of the truck. An air-intake snorkel, a roof guard, and passenger-side storage lockers are other details. One of the hoses on the front-end loader leaks.",

The batteries were replaced in late 2023 according to the seller.",
      "Power is sent to all four wheels through a four-speed manual gearbox, a dual-range transfer case, locking differentials, and portal axles.",

    "description": [
      "This 1959 Chevrolet Apache 3100 was acquired by the prior owner in 2020 as a non-running project that was burned in Paradise, California during the 2018 Camp wildfire. It was subsequently modified and refurbished with work consisting of replacing the frame and running gear, refinishing the corroded sheet metal in clearcoat, retrimming the interior in black leather and suede, and installing a modified 6.0-liter LQ9 V8 and a four-speed automatic transmission. Additional equipment includes a narrowed rear end, a Detroit Truetrac limited-slip differential, power-assisted rack-and-pinion steering, air suspension with an AccuAir control system, QA1 adjustable dampers, Wilwood disc brakes, 20″ Bespoke Billet Wheels, a 3″ stainless-steel dual exhaust system with Borla mufflers, a Classic Instruments gauge cluster, Restomod climate control, and a Bluetooth stereo with four speakers and two subwoofers. The truck was previously listed on BaT in November 2023 and was acquired by the selling dealer in June 2024. This 3100 is offered at no reserve in Texas with a clean California title.",
      "The pickup was burned in the 2018 Camp Fire, which destroyed the town of Paradise, California and was the deadliest wildfire in California history. The fleetside body was reportedly treated with CLR rust remover before being refinished in matte clearcoat over visible surface corrosion, dents, and perforations. Additional work included installing a custom bed floor and side-exit exhaust ports, widening the wheel tubs, and replacing the firewall, glass, badges, and sheet metal around the transmission tunnel. The bed features a wood-lined floor as well as a cutout to accommodate the air tanks for the suspension system. Additional details include steel bumpers, quad LED headlights, dual mirrors with black housings, and a fold-down tailgate with chain supports. Rust is present on the grille, front bumper, above the left wheel arch, and on the wheel tubs. The wheel tubs have not been clear-coated.",
      "Staggered-width 20″ Bespoke Billet wheels are finished in antique bronze with matching hubcaps and are mounted with 245/35 front and 345/25 rear Lexani LX Twenty tires. Stopping power is from Wilwood six-piston front and four-piston rear calipers over cross-drilled rotors. A Roadster Shop Slammed SPEC Series frame and multi-link rear suspension setup were installed during the build along with an air suspension system with Fox airbags, QA1 adjustable shocks, dual Viair compressors, FLO air tanks, and an AccuAir control system.",
      "The cabin houses a Snowden bench seat trimmed in black leather with suede inserts that extend to the door panels, cup holder console, and headliner. The windshield, side windows, rear windscreen, weatherstripping, switches, handles, and wiring harness were replaced during the build, and sound-damping material was applied throughout the cabin. An AccuAir suspension control panel is mounted to the floor console, and additional features include black-painted sheet metal, an unfinished dash top, black carpets, a Lokar column shifter, Restomod climate control, power windows, a glove box, lap belts, and a Bluetooth stereo with Focal speakers and JL Audio subwoofers. Stitches are missing from the driver’s side seat cushion insert.",
      "The two-spoke steering wheel features a bronze horn ring and is mounted on an Ididit tilt-adjustable column. Classic Instruments instrumentation includes a 140-mph speedometer, an 8k-rpm tachometer, and gauges for coolant temperature, voltage, oil pressure, and fuel level. The five-digit odometer indicates 5k miles, though total chassis mileage is unknown.",
      "The 6.0-liter LQ9 V8 was installed during the build, and Holley equipment includes Sniper fuel injection, a serpentine accessory drive, a Terminator ECU, and an upgraded intake manifold and oil pan. Additional features include a gold-painted block, black Chevrolet-script valve covers, a Melling oil pump, MSD electronic ignition, an aluminum radiator, stainless steel headers, a 3″ exhaust system, a 20-gallon fuel tank, and dual Odyssey AGM batteries.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels via a 4L80 four-speed automatic transmission, a narrowed 9″ rear axle assembly, and an Eaton Detroit Truetrac limited-slip differential with 4.11:1 gearing. Rust is visible on the underside."

Equipment includes a limited-slip differential, 18″ five-spoke alloy wheels, “smooth” air-intake tubes, a removable hardtop, power windows, an Alpine CD stereo, and air conditioning. This Viper is now offered by the seller on behalf of the owner with a window sticker, the owner’s manual, and a Florida title.",

The RT/10 is equipped with power-assisted rack-and-pinion steering, four-wheel independent suspension, and four-wheel vented disc brakes with Viper-branded calipers up front. 2000 models were not equipped with ABS.",

      "The three-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a 200-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 6k-rpm redline. Auxiliary gauges for coolant temperature, oil pressure, fuel level, and voltage are mounted atop the center stack. The six-digit odometer shows 8k miles.",
      "The 8.0-liter OHV V10 was factory rated at 450 horsepower. “Smooth” air-intake tubes have been fitted, and the muffler has been removed.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a Tremec T-56 six-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential.",
      "The window sticker lists initial delivery to Don Miller Dodge in Madison, Wisconsin, along with factory equipment, colors, and a total price of $73,700.",
      "The Carfax report shows at least one open recall.",
      "There is currently a lien out on the car, and the seller’s lender will need to be paid off before the title can be transferred to the new owner."

This example is finished in Guards Red and has LED headlights with PDLS+, a backup camera, black rear stone guards, carbon-fiber mirror caps, a speed-activated rear spoiler, and dual exhaust outlets.",

Carbon-fiber trim accents the interior, and additional appointments include aluminum pedals, a Bose sound system, carbon-fiber illuminated door sill guards, Porsche-branded floor mats, Porsche Communication Management with navigation, dual-zone automatic climate control, and cruise control.",

Factory rated power output was 502 horsepower and 346 lb-ft of torque. According to the seller, the car is due for an oil service.",

      "This 2018 Porsche 911 GT3 Touring is a black-finished example that has 6k miles, and it was optioned from the factory with Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes, a front-axle lift system, the Touring Package in Black, and Guards Red instrument dials and seat belts. Satin paint protection film and red Porsche hood and side graphics have been added, and the interior is trimmed in black extended leather and fabric upholstery with deviated red stitching. Powered by a 4.0-liter flat-six paired with a six-speed manual transaxle, the car is equipped with the Sport Chrono Package, 20″ center-lock alloy wheels, an extended-range fuel tank, LED headlights, a backup camera, carbon-fiber-backed bucket seats, a Bose sound system, and Porsche Torque Vectoring. Acquired by the selling dealer in 2024, this 991.2 GT3 Touring is now offered in Indiana with an accident-free Carfax report and a clean Virginia title.",
      "The GT3 Touring includes a revised decklid with a mesh grille as well as a retractable rear spoiler in place of the raised wing found on the standard GT3. This example is finished in black and features satin paint protection film with red Porsche hood and side graphics. Exterior details consist of black window trim and rear Porsche lettering, a backup camera, LED taillights, and LED headlights with Porsche Dynamic Lighting System (PDLS). Imperfections are noted on the front splitter.",
      "The gloss-black finished 20″ center-lock alloy wheels are mounted with 245/35 front and 305/30 rear Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires that show 2018 production codes. The car was optioned with a front-axle lift system, and braking is handled by yellow Porsche-branded calipers over ceramic-composite rotors.",
      "The cabin houses carbon-fiber-backed bucket seats trimmed in black leather with fabric inserts and deviated red stitching that extends to the interior panels. Leather upholstery covers the dashboard and door panels, and additional appointments include Guards Red seatbelts, a Bose sound system, PCM with navigation, cruise control, and Porsche-branded floor mats with red stitching.",
      "A three-spoke steering wheel frames a central GT3-branded tachometer with a Guards Red dial as well as a 225-mph speedometer, an LCD screen, and gauges for oil pressure, oil temperature, coolant temperature, and fuel level. The optional Sport Chrono Package added a stopwatch atop the dashboard. The digital odometer indicates 6k miles. A November 2023 entry in the Carfax report lists a mileage inconsistency, though the report indicates this may be the result of a clerical error.",
      "The 4.0-liter flat-six was factory rated at 500 horsepower and 339 lb-ft of torque, which is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed manual transaxle with Porsche Torque Vectoring. The car is equipped with an extended-range 23.7-gallon fuel tank.",
      "The window sticker shows factory colors, equipment, and a total price of $209,350.",
      "The Carfax report lists the aforementioned mileage inconsistency."

      "Instrumentation consists of a handlebar-mounted 50-km/h speedometer and an oil indicator light as well as a fuel-level gauge located atop the fuel tank. No odometer was equipped from the factory, therefore total mileage is unknown.",
      "The air-cooled 49cc two-stroke single is mounted horizontally and was factory rated at 2.5 horsepower and 2.75 lb-ft of torque. Features include oil injection, a kickstarter, and an exhaust system that is tucked beneath the rear bodywork. The seller notes that the oil indicator light remains, even when the tank is full.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheel via a single-speed transmission with an automatic clutch.",
      "The Motocompo was designed to fold and fit into the trunk of the contemporary Honda City. The handlebars, seat, and foot pegs fold flat, and the body features a master fuel switch as well as integrated lift handles and tie-down points to facilitate transport."

Exterior equipment includes a powered sunroof, double-pane side glass, soft-close doors, rear parking aerials, a power antenna, and headlight wipers. The Carfax Canada report lists a glass record in May 2004 as well as a collision in May 2022, and the seller notes the windshield has been replaced.

      "This 1967 Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow is reported to be one of ten pre-production long-wheelbase examples produced and was initially ordered by a publishing magnate in San Francisco. Now finished in black over beige Connolly leather, the car is powered by a 6.2-liter V8 paired with a three-speed automatic transmission. Equipment includes 15″ steel wheels with full covers, power-adjustable front seats, rear-passenger tables and footrests, power windows, and air conditioning. Following the seller’s 2019 acquisition, the brake system was refurbished along with the dual SU carburetors and the distributor. This Silver Shadow LWB is now offered with factory correspondence, a 1967 invoice, service records, spare parts, a car cover, and a clean Minnesota title in the seller’s name.",
      "Factory finished in Sable, the four-door saloon wears an older repaint in black performed under previous ownership. It is equipped with a stainless-steel Doric-inspired grille with a Spirit of Ecstasy ornament and quad round headlights. Dents and dings are present around the bodywork, there are rust holes in the rear valance, and the windshield wipers require repair.",
      "Steel 15″ wheels with full covers wear 235/70 Michelin XVS tires. Factory equipment included a four-wheel independent suspension with coil springs, anti-roll bars, telescopic dampers, and a hydraulic self-leveling system. Stopping power is provided by disc brakes at all four corners. The brake calipers are said to have been rebuilt in 2019 along with the fluid reservoir, pumps, switches, and spheres. The hoses were replaced, and the seller states the system has since been flushed every other year.",
      "The power-adjustable front bucket seats are upholstered in beige Connolly leather, while wood trim accents the dashboard, center console, and door panels. Interior appointments include a rear bench seat, flip-out tray tables for the rear passengers, rear-passenger footrests, power windows, air conditioning, and an aftermarket stereo.",
      "The steering wheel frames Smiths instrumentation consisting of a 130-mph speedometer alongside an ammeter and gauges for fuel level, oil pressure, and coolant temperature. The five-digit odometer shows 88k miles, approximately 1k of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The 6.2-liter V8 is fitted with dual SU carburetors along with an electric fuel pump and a Ford alternator. The carburetors and ignition distributor were reportedly rebuilt in 2019.",
      "Power is routed to the rear wheels through a GM-sourced three-speed automatic transmission, and the seller states the shift servo was cleaned in preparation for the sale.",
      "The underhood plate indicates chassis number LRX2718, while the Minnesota title shows a VIN of RR67LRX2718."

It has been modified with a license-plate relocation kit, Superleggera wheels, Gilles rearsets, an Oberon clutch slave, AELLA frame sliders, Rizoma Stealth mirrors, and Rizoma brake and clutch levers. Additional equipment includes Ducati’s Quick Shift (DQS) system, a carbon-fiber clutch cover guard, carbon-fiber fenders, semi-active Öhlins suspension components, and triple disc brakes with Brembo calipers and cornering ABS as well as a color TFT digital dashboard with controls for the suspension, engine braking control, riding and power modes, and EVO traction and wheelie control. This Panigale S Anniversario is now offered with removed parts, an AGV Pista GP helmet, records, a pit stand, owner’s literature, and a clean Alaska title in the seller’s name.",

It features a cast alloy monocoque frame that utilizes the engine as a stressed member in addition to carbon-fiber trim, a clear windscreen, AELLA frame sliders, a relocated license plate kit, Gilles rear-set foot controls, and Rizoma mirrors and control levers.",
      "Superleggera 17″ forged magnesium wheels are finished in gold and wear 120/70 front and 200/55 rear Pirelli Diablo Supercorsa tires. The Bosch six-axis IMU provides cornering anti-lock braking capability, and stopping power is provided by dual 330mm discs with radially mounted Brembo M50 four-piston calipers up front as well as a 245mm disc with a Brembo two-piston caliper at the rear.",

      "This 1968 Chevrolet K10 Suburban was acquired by the selling dealer in 2019 and subsequently underwent a refurbishment that involved a repaint in teal and an interior re-trim. Power is provided by a replacement 350ci V8 paired with floor-mounted shifters controlling the four-speed manual transmission and dual-range transfer case. Features include a single driver-side door along with a pair of passenger curbside doors and a clamshell-style tailgate. On the inside, the bench seats are trimmed in black vinyl and cloth, and additional equipment includes polished 17″ alloy wheels, Monroe Gas-Magnum shocks, Mile Market locking front hubs, a Rancho steering stabilizer, and an aftermarket head unit. This K10 Suburban is now offered with a clean Montana title in the name of the selling dealer.",
      "The truck is configured with a single driver-side door as well as a pair of passenger curbside doors and a clamshell-style tailgate. It was repainted in its current shade of teal as part of the aforementioned refurbishment completed under current ownership. Aftermarket tint film has been applied to the rear windows.",
      "Polished 17″ alloy wheels are wrapped in BFGoodrich Trail-Terrain T/A tires. The front axle is fitted with Mile Marker manually locking hubs, and the truck rides on Monroe Gas-Magnum shocks. Further equipment includes a Rancho steering stabilizer, power steering, and power-assisted four-wheel drum brakes.",
      "The cabin houses two bench seats that have been reupholstered in black vinyl with gray cloth inserts. The shifter and transfer-case selector exit from the floor, which is lined in gray carpet. An aftermarket head unit has been added, and further details include a heater, vent windows, and lap belts.",
      "The split-spoke steering wheel sits ahead of a 100-mph speedometer and auxiliary gauges. The five-digit odometer shows 68k miles, and true mileage is unknown.",
      "The replacement 350ci V8 was installed under previous ownership. It is equipped with a Summit Racing air cleaner as well as GM Goodwrench–branded valve covers.",
      "Power is sent to the rear or all four wheels through a four-speed manual transmission and a dual-range transfer case."

      "This 2011 Aston Martin DBS Volante has remained registered in California through the current owner’s acquisition in 2021. The car was specified with a carbon-fiber front spoiler, rear diffuser, and mirror caps, and it is finished in Jet Black over Obsidian Black leather upholstery. Power is provided by a 6.0-liter V12, and additional equipment consists of a six-speed automatic transaxle, 20″ wheels, carbon-ceramic brakes, parking sensors, power-adjustable and heated seats, automatic climate control, a Bang & Olufsen sound system, and a pop-up navigation screen. This DBS has 26k miles and is now offered with manufacturer’s literature, an umbrella, two keys, a tire inflation kit, a clean Carfax report, and a California title.",
      "Jet Black (AST1328H) paint finishes the exterior, and features consist of a decklid spoiler and side sill extensions as well as a carbon-fiber front lip spoiler, rear diffuser, and mirror supports. Additional equipment includes a black convertible soft top, xenon headlights, front and rear parking sensors, and dual exhaust outlets. A paint correction and full PPF was reportedly applied in 2021. There are paint chips on the front end, a section of the soft top is raised above the rear window, and additional photos of the exterior condition are viewable in the gallery below.",
      "The 20″ forged alloy wheels are mounted with 245/35 and 295/30 Pirelli P Zero tires. Braking is handled by carbon-ceramic rotors with Aston Martin S-branded black six-piston calipers up front and four-piston calipers out back. The brake fluid was flushed in February 2024, according to the seller.",
      "The cabin features Obsidian Black leather upholstery with DBS-embroidered seat back logos as well as a color-matching center console and carpets. Piano black veneers accent the dashboard, and additional appointments consist of power-adjustable and heated front seats with memory settings as well as carbon-fiber door panel trim, automatic climate control, auto-dimming mirrors, a Bang & Olufsen sound system, and a pop-up navigation screen. Creases are present on the driver’s seat.",
      "The leather-wrapped steering wheel features paddle shifters and frames a 220-mph speedometer, a reverse-sweep tachometer, and gauges for coolant temperature and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 26k miles, approximately 7k of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The 6.0-liter V12 was factory rated at 510 horsepower and 420 lb-ft of torque. An oil change was performed in February 2024.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a rear-mounted six-speed automatic transaxle.",
      "The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage.",
      "There is currently a lien on the car, and the seller’s lender will need to be paid off before the title can be transferred to the next owner."

      "This 1976 Motobecane Mobylette 50L is finished in orange and powered by a 49cc two-stroke single mated to an automatic centrifugal clutch. It is equipped with an underslung exhaust and a crankset and pedals for starting as well as a solo saddle, orange saddle bags, leg guards, drum brakes, full suspension, and wire-spoke wheels with 17″ chrome steel rims. The seller acquired the moped out of a collection in 2022 and subsequently replaced the carburetor. This Moby 50L is now offered at no reserve in Florida with a bill of sale.",
      "The moped is finished in orange and features a pressed-steel frame with a one-gallon fuel tank integrated with the backbone. Color-matched leg guards have been added, and additional equipment includes a stainless-steel front fender, a black solo saddle, a headlight and taillight, a chrome rear luggage rack, a center stand, and orange vinyl saddle bags with white piping. The side covers are missing.",
      "Wire-spoke wheels with 17″ chrome steel rims are mounted with 2.25″-width street tires. Suspension consists of an inverted telescopic fork along with a pair of shrouded shocks fitted to the swingarm. Braking is handled by drums at both ends. The fork gaiters are torn.",
      "The chrome high-rise handlebar carries a front brake lever and ignition switchgear on the left as well as a twist-grip throttle and levers for the rear brake and compression release on the right. The headlight bucket houses a Huret 35-mph speedometer with an inset four-digit odometer that shows 3,200 miles. Approximately 50 miles were ridden by the seller.",
      "The 49cc two-stroke single features a crankset and pedals for starting along with a six-volt electrical system and an underslung exhaust system. Power is sent to the rear wheel via an automatic centrifugal clutch and a drive chain. A replacement carburetor was installed in 2022.",
      "The moped does not have a title or registration. It is being sold on a bill of sale only."

      "This 1991 Mercedes-Benz 300CE coupe was first registered in Ontario and relocated to California after the seller’s purchase in 1999. The car is powered by a 3.0-liter M104 inline-six paired with a four-speed automatic transmission, and it is finished in black over black leather upholstery. Equipment includes 15″ Alamak alloy wheels, a sunroof, heated power-adjustable front seats, a cassette stereo, a trunk-mounted CD changer, automatic climate control, and R134a-based air conditioning. This C124 300CE shows 224k miles and is offered with manufacturer’s literature and a clean California title in the seller’s name.",
      "The car is finished in black with gray lower cladding and exterior features include a sunroof, headlight wipers and washers, fog lights, a power antenna, and a mono-blade windshield wiper. An October 2001 entry on the Carfax report lists “moderate damage” to the left front corner of the car, and the seller notes corrosion beneath the right rear tail light and left rear wheel well. There is a ding in the right rear fender and a crack in the windshield, and close-up photographs of the exterior finish and trim are shown in the gallery below.",
      "Silver 15″ Alamak alloy wheels are mounted with Khumo Ecsta tires. Braking is handled by ventilated front and solid rear disc brakes with ABS.",
      "The cabin features seating upholstered in black leather along with wood trim and a color-coordinated dashboard, center console, door panels, and carpets. Interior appointments include heated power-adjustable front seats, driver position memory, a cassette stereo linked to a trunk-mounted CD changer, automatic climate control, a passenger airbag, and air conditioning, the latter of which has been converted to utilize R134a refrigerant. The wood trim is cracked and the cruise control does not work.",
      "The four-spoke steering wheel frames VDO instrumentation including a replacement 160-mph speedometer and a tachometer as well as an analog clock and gauges for coolant temperature, oil pressure, and fuel level. The six-digit odometer shows 224k miles, approximately 140k of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The 3.0-liter M104 inline-six was factory-rated at 217 horsepower and 229 lb-ft of torque, which is sent to the rear wheels through a four-speed automatic transmission. The seller notes that a larger diameter cooling fan, transmission cooler, and revised viscous fan clutch have been added. The car passed a California emissions inspection in preparation for the sale.",
      "Additional underside photos are provided in the gallery.",
      "The Carfax report lists the aforementioned October 2001 damage. An entry in March 2014 states that the car was designated a gross polluter in California, although the car has since passed California emissions inspections, including most recently in June 2024.",
      "The car is registered as Planned Non-Operation in the state of California."

      "This Factory Five Racing Mk3 Roadster was assembled between 2006 and 2008 by the seller’s father-in-law, who fitted a Ford Racing 302ci V8 that is linked to a Tremec World Class T-5 five-speed manual transmission and an 8.8″ rear axle with a limited-slip differential. The car is finished in red over black vinyl upholstery and features a removable hardtop, polished bumperettes, a single roll hoop, and AC badging. Additional details include a wood-rimmed steering wheel, AutoMeter instrumentation, a fire extinguisher, 15″ Halibrand-style wheels, disc brakes, adjustable coilovers, an Edelbrock Weber carburetor, a Mallory distributor, and a rear-exit dual exhaust system. Acquired by the seller in 2018, this Mk3 Roadster is now offered with a Manufacturer’s Statement of Origin, build documents, spare parts, and a clean Georgia title in the seller’s name describing it as a 1964 ACE Convertible.",
      "The fiberglass body is said to have been coated in Dupont 4004S primer before being finished in red with Dupont Centari acrylic enamel, per the seller. Exterior details include polished bumperettes, a hood scoop, fender vents, a Talbot Berlin-style mirror, wind wings, a single roll hoop, AC badging, and a Le Mans-style fuel filler. A black hardtop is included in the sale.",
      "Halibrand-style 15″ wheels wear faux knock-off spinners and are mounted with BF Goodrich Radial T/A white letter tires measuring 235/60 up front and 275/50 out back. The car is equipped with rack-and-pinion steering, Bilstein adjustable coilovers, adjustable front upper control arms, a three-link rear suspension, and a rear panhard bar. Stopping power is provided by four-wheel disc brakes.",
      "The low-back bucket seats are trimmed in black vinyl and are fitted with Simpson racing harnesses. Additional interior elements include a center console, leather door check straps, a glove compartment, a fire extinguisher, AC-branded pedals, and a passenger grab handle. The fuse block is mounted in the glove compartment. The windshield blower motor is inoperative.",
      "The wood-rimmed steering wheel wears an AC-branded center cap and fronts a black upholstered dashboard housing AutoMeter instrumentation consisting of a reverse-sweep 180-mph speedometer, a tachometer, and gauges for oil pressure, oil temperature, coolant temperature, voltage, and fuel level. The five-digit mechanical odometer shows 1,500 miles, approximately 600 of which have been added under current ownership.",
      "The front-hinged hood opens to reveal a Ford Racing 302ci V8 with 9.0:1 compression and equipped with GT-40 aluminum cylinder heads, a dual plane “Performer RPM” intake manifold, a hydraulic roller camshaft, roller rockers, a Mallory distributor, an Edelbrock Weber four-barrel 600-CFM carburetor, and Short tube headers that flow into a 2.5″ dual exhaust with Flowmaster mufflers. Work under current ownership reportedly included repairing an intake manifold leak and performing fluid changes.",
      "Power is delivered to the rear wheels through a Tremec World Class T-5 five-speed manual transmission and an 8.8″ rear axle with a Summit Racing girdle cover and a limited-slip differential.",

      "This 2018 Volkswagen Golf R was purchased new by its late owner at Molle Volkswagen of Kansas City, Missouri, and it now indicates 21k miles. Finished in Lapiz Blue Metallic over Titan Black leather upholstery, the car is powered by a turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-four linked with a seven-speed automatic transaxle and a 4MOTION all-wheel-drive system. It has been modified with an Integrated Engineering intake, a RacingLine oil catch can, OZ Racing 19″ Ultraleggera HLT wheels, and APR components including an intercooler, ignition coils, lowering springs, engine control unit (ECU) and transmission control unit (TCU) tunes, and exhaust components. Additional features include selectable driving modes, adaptive LED headlights, adaptive cruise control, heated front sport seats, and Fender Premium Audio linked to an 8″ touchscreen infotainment system with navigation, VW AppConnect, satellite radio, and Bluetooth connectivity. This Golf R is offered at no reserve by the seller on behalf of the late owner’s estate with a window sticker, service and parts invoices, spare and removed parts, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Missouri title.",
      "The Golf R is differentiated from the standard Golf by revised bodywork including the hatch spoiler, rear diffuser, front fascia with larger air intakes, and side skirts. This example is finished in Lapiz Blue Metallic (L9L9) with black lower-body accents and mirror caps. Clear paint protection film was applied to a portion of the front fascia along with the rear bumper cover, headlight lenses, rocker panels, and lower doors in 2018. The seller states that the car was damaged by hail in 2022, and subsequent work included repairing and refinishing a portion of the left roof rail along with performing paintless dent repair on the hood, roof, doors, front fenders, quarter panels, and tailgate. The right-side taillight lens is cracked.",
      "OZ Racing 19″ Ultraleggera HLT wheels were mounted with 235/35 Continental ExtremeContact DWS 06 Plus tires in April 2024. The four-wheel independent sport suspension features adaptive Dynamic Chassis Control dampers and has been modified with APR lowering springs. Stopping power is provided by four-wheel ventilated disc brakes with black-finished R-branded front calipers. The seller notes blemishes on the right-front wheel.",
      "The cabin features seating surfaces upholstered in Titan Black leather with contrasting piping, and embroidered R emblems accent the backrests of the heated “Top Sport” front bucket seats. Amenities include a power-adjustable driver’s seat, dual-zone automatic climate control, keyless entry, ambient lighting, “Carbon Touch” dashboard and door panel trim, selectable driving modes, and Fender Premium Audio linked to an 8″ infotainment system with navigation, VW AppConnect smartphone integration, satellite radio, and Bluetooth connectivity. Driver-assistance systems comprise active blind-spot monitoring, lane-keeping assist, and adaptive cruise control with forward collision warning and autonomous emergency braking. A COBB Tuning AccessPort tuning module is mounted ahead of the driver-side air vent.",
      "The leather-wrapped multifunction steering wheel is equipped with paddle shifters and fronts a Volkswagen Digital Cockpit instrument display, which contains a configurable central menu, a 200-mph speedometer with an inset coolant temperature gauge, and a tachometer with an inset fuel level gauge. The digital odometer indicates 21k miles.",
      "The turbocharged 2.0-liter EA888 inline-four features direct fuel injection, dual overhead camshafts, and a replacement turbocharger, and it drives all four wheels through a seven-speed automatic transaxle and a 4MOTION all-wheel drive system. The engine was fitted with a replacement long block by Habibi Motorsports of Maryland Heights, Missouri, in May 2020, and it has been modified with an Integrated Engineering intake, a Racingline oil catch can, and APR components including an engine control unit (ECU) tune, a transmission control unit (TCU) tune, an intercooler, ignition coils, an exhaust downpipe without an integrated catalyst, and an exhaust system with black-finished 3.5″ tips.",
      "Additional underbody photos are presented in the gallery below.",
      "The included window sticker displays initial delivery to Molle Volkswagen of Kansas City, Missouri, and it lists factory colors and equipment along with a total price of $42,055. Removed Englishtown wheels, service and parts invoices, and various additional spare and removed parts will also accompany the car.",
      "The Carfax report shows no accidents or other damage and lists history in Missouri."

      "This 2023 Audi R8 is number 157 of 333 GT models produced for the model year, and it is one of 50 Mythos Black Metallic examples allocated to the US. The interior is upholstered in black Nappa leather and Alcantara, and the car is powered by a 5.2-liter V10 mated to a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transaxle. Additional equipment includes forged 20″ Audi Sport wheels, a carbon-fiber front roll bar, carbon-ceramic brakes, LED headlights, and carbon-fiber bodywork and interior trim in addition to selectable Torque Rear slip control, an Audi Virtual Cockpit instrument panel, heated seats, Bang & Olufsen audio, automatic climate control, and Audi MMI infotainment with navigation. Acquired by the selling dealer in March 2024, this R8 GT has 10k miles and is now offered with a tool and tire-inflation kit, a clean Carfax report, and a clean California title.",
      "Audi allocated 150 of the second-generation R8 GT cars to the US market, and this example is finished in Mythos Black Metallic with a carbon-fiber aero package consisting of a front splitter and canards, side skirts, a rear diffuser and bumper-side elements, and a goose-neck rear wing. Additional exterior details include LED headlights with Audi Laser Light along with Carbon Sigma side blades, front and rear parking sensors, and dual black-finished exhaust outlets. The front splitter was replaced in preparation for the sale.",
      "Forged 20″ Audi Sport wheels are finished in black and wear 245/30 front and 305/30 rear Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires. The factory sport suspension system features a carbon-fiber front sway bar, and braking is provided by carbon-ceramic brakes with six-piston calipers and 380mm rotors up front along with four-piston calipers and 356mm rotors out back.",
      "The heated and power-height-adjustable seats are trimmed in black Nappa leather with Alcantara inserts as well as red stitching and matching backrest embroidery. Additional appointments include carbon-fiber trim, red seat belts, automatic climate control, a Bang & Olufsen audio system, a diamond-stitched Alcantara headliner, and Audi MMI infotainment with navigation.",
      "Production numbers embedded in the center-console trim indicate this is number 157 of 333 R8 GT examples produced.",
      "The suede-wrapped, flat-bottom steering wheel carries selectors for Torque Rear mode, which allows variable levels of rear-wheel slip. Shift paddles and a configurable Audi Virtual Cockpit instrument display are ahead, and the digital odometer shows 10k miles.",
      "The 5.2-liter V10 was factory rated at 602 horsepower and 413 lb-ft of torque. The oil was most recently changed in February 2024.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a seven-speed S Tronic dual-clutch automatic transaxle.",
      "The window sticker lists initial delivery to Audi Van Nuys in Sherman Oaks, California, factory colors and equipment, and a total manufacturer’s suggested retail price of $253,290.",
      "The Carfax report is free of accident or damage entries."

      "This 2007 Subaru Impreza WRX STi is powered by a turbocharged 2.5-liter flat-four that was serviced with a replacement short block in December 2023, at which time the cylinder heads are said to have been rebuilt and various gaskets were replaced. Power is sent to all four wheels through a six-speed manual transaxle, a driver-controlled center differential, and limited-slip front and rear differentials. Finished in Urban Gray Metallic over black and blue upholstery, the car has been fitted with an aftermarket exhaust system and a Pioneer head unit. It also has a rear spoiler, Brembo brake calipers, black-finished 17″ 10-spoke wheels, and automatic climate control. The selling dealer acquired the car in April 2023, and subsequent service is noted to have included replacing the oil pump, crankshaft seals, and spark plugs. This WRX STi has 138k miles and is offered in California at no reserve with service records and a clean Montana title.",
      "The car is finished in Urban Gray Metallic (45A) and features an aluminum hood with a scoop as well as HID headlights, side skirts, power-adjustable mirrors, a roof spoiler, and a single exhaust outlet. The selling dealer notes the trunk lid has been replaced, and the Carfax report notes damage to the front and right side in January 2015. Close-up photos of the paintwork and trim are presented in the gallery.",
      "Black-finished 17″ 10-spoke wheels are mounted with 245/45 TBB TR-66 tires. Stopping power is provided by four-wheel disc brakes with Brembo four-piston front and two-piston rear calipers over cross-drilled and slotted rotors. Service in December 2023 included replacing the front struts, strut mounts, ball joints, control arms, and lower control arm bushings.",
      "The front bucket seats are trimmed in black cloth with blue Alcantara inserts, and color-coordinated upholstery extends to the rear seats and the door panels. Amenities include cruise control, automatic climate control, and a Pioneer head unit with a CD player and Bluetooth in addition to a Blaupunkt amplifier stored in the trunk. The door trim and shifter linkage bushings were reportedly replaced in 2024.",
      "The leather-wrapped steering wheel is noted to have been replaced in February 2024 and fronts a 160-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 7k-rpm redline as well as gauges for fuel level and coolant temperature. The digital odometer indicates 138k miles, approximately 900 of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The turbocharged 2.5-liter flat-four was reportedly fitted with a replacement short block in December 2023, a work order for which can be viewed in the gallery. Subsequent service is said to have included replacing the oil pump, cylinder head gaskets, crankshaft seals, timing belt, mass airflow sensor, engine mounts, accessory belts, fuel tank, spark plugs, and thermostat. The Carfax report notes the short block was replaced in 2007.",
      "Power is sent to all four wheels through a six-speed manual transaxle, a driver-controlled center differential, and limited-slip front and rear differentials. An aftermarket exhaust system with a catalytic converter has been installed according to the selling dealer.",
      "The Carfax report lists the aforementioned damage entry.",
      "The selling dealer states that the car cannot pass a California emissions test, therefore it cannot be sold to an in-state private party buyer."

    "description": [
      "This 1963 Chevrolet Corvair Monza convertible is powered by a turbocharged 145ci flat-six paired with a four-speed manual transaxle and is finished in Saddle Tan over matching vinyl upholstery. Equipment includes a tan convertible soft top, a louvered rear decklid, 13″ steel wheels, four-wheel independent suspension, Pertronix electronic ignition, a retro-styled digital radio, and a heater. Refurbishment work in 2006-07 included repairing rust damage, replacing the top, and re-plating or replacing the trim along with rebuilding the turbocharger, differential, brakes, and more as detailed below. The battery, voltage regulator, and fuel lines were replaced in 2023 along with the wheel bearings and the front brake lines and wheel cylinders. With known history in Michigan and Florida, the car was acquired by the selling dealer in April 2024 and subsequently repainted. This Corvair Monza convertible is now offered with service records, spare parts, and a Florida title.",
      "The Corvair was the first unibody model produced by Fisher Body, and this example was factory-finished in Saddle Tan (932). Rust repairs and body-panel replacements were carried out before a repaint in 2007, and the selling dealer reports another exterior repaint in preparation for the sale. Features include a replacement tan convertible soft top and a matching top boot in addition to quad T-3 headlights, dual side mirrors, and bright bumpers.",
      "Steel 13″ wheels with a mixed set of covers are mounted with 185/80 Hankook Radial H714 thin-whitewall tires that have 2008 production-date codes. The Corvair’s factory independent suspension utilized coil springs all around and swing axles at the rear, and it was rebuilt in 2006. IECO quick-steering arms and 1964-style finned brake drums were installed at that time, and the wheel bearings were replaced in 2023 along with the front hubs, brake lines, and wheel cylinders.",
      "The front bucket seats and the rear bench are upholstered in Saddle vinyl (705), and the door panels are trimmed to match. Interior appointments include a heater, aftermarket front headrests, a vintage-styled digital radio, a tissue dispenser, and front lap belts. A crack in the dashboard, above the radio, is depicted in the gallery.",
      "The two-spoke steering wheel features a chrome horn ring and frames a 120-mph speedometer, a 6k-rpm tachometer, and gauges for manifold pressure, cylinder-head temperature, and fuel level. The five-digit odometer shows 29k miles, approximately 20 of which were added under current ownership. The car’s Florida title carries a “not actual” odometer notation, and total mileage is unknown.",
      "The rear-mounted, air-cooled, and turbocharged 145ci flat-six was factory rated at 150 horsepower and 210 lb-ft of torque, and a Purolator fuel-pressure regulator and Pertronix electronic-ignition components have been fitted. The turbocharger was rebuilt in 2006, and its housing was ceramic-coated along with the inlet and outlet. In February 2023, the battery, voltage regulator, and fuel lines were replaced.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a four-speed manual transaxle, and an IECO shifter is in place. The differential was rebuilt in 2006 with 3.27:1 final-drive gearing, and the clutch was replaced at that time. The exhaust system has been ceramic-coated.",
      "Decoding the Fisher body tag reveals:",
      "Spare parts are included in the sale."

It is powered by an 883cc V-twin mated with a five-speed transmission and is finished in orange with checkered-flag graphics. Features include black-finished engine trim, triple disc brakes, a two-up seat, mid controls, and a two-into-one exhaust system. This XL883R is now offered at no reserve by the selling dealer in Missouri with a clean Illinois title.",
      "The bike is finished in orange with black and silver graphics, and it features a black two-up seat and mid controls.",
      "Thirteen-spoke cast alloy wheels measuring 19″ up front and 16″ at the rear are wrapped in Dunlop tires. Suspension consists of a telescopic fork as well as a pair of preload-adjustable shocks mounted to the swingarm. Braking is handled by dual discs up front and a single version out back.",
      "The black-finished handlebar carries dual mirrors and is secured by a black-finished clamp with a bright badge bearing a Harley-Davidson 100th Anniversary logo along with a “2003 XL 88R 100th Anniversary” inscription. The digital odometer indicates 74 miles, three of which have been ridden by the selling dealer.",
      "The 883cc Sportster Evolution V-twin features black powder-coated cases, a matching battery cover and oil tank, and a chrome two-into-one exhaust system. The battery has been replaced in the last year, and an oil change was performed in June 2024.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheel via a multi-plate wet clutch, a five-speed transmission, and a drive belt with a black belt guard."

Rebuilds on the 327ci V8 and four-speed manual transmission were commissioned in 2016 and 2022, respectively, and further equipment includes a Holley carburetor, a side-outlet exhaust system, flip-up headlights, chrome bumperettes, 15″ turbine-style wheels, drum brakes, and power steering. The cabin is outfitted with black vinyl upholstery, a heater, a cueball shift knob, and an AM/FM radio. This C2 convertible is offered on dealer consignment with service records, refurbishment photos, and a Mississippi title.",

Details include a black soft top, a body-color hardtop, flip-up headlights, fender vents, and a side-outlet exhaust system with heat shields. Photos of the soft top in the raised position are provided in the gallery.",
      "The 15″ turbine-style wheels are mounted with Cooper Trendsetter SE white-stripe tires. The C2 was the first Corvette to offer fully independent suspension, with upper and lower control arms at the front and a three-link setup with a transverse leaf spring at the rear. Braking is handled by four-wheel drums.",

The five-digit odometer shows 86k miles, approximately 3k of which were added under current ownership. Total mileage is unknown.",
      "The 327ci V8 was rebuilt in October 2016 by Dorr’s Automotive in Louisiana, and it was painted orange and black before being reinstalled. It is equipped with a Holley 4160 carburetor and a chrome air cleaner lid and ignition cover. Distributor repairs were completed in 2019, and insulation was applied to the firewall in July 2021.",

      "This 1997 Nissan Stagea 25X is a right-hand-drive Japanese-market wagon powered by a 2.5-liter DOHC inline-six driving the rear wheels through a four-speed automatic transmission. Finished in Super Clear Red II over gray cloth, the car is equipped with a rear spoiler, roof rails, 16″ alloy wheels, four-wheel disc brakes with ABS, power windows and locks, automatic climate control, and a factory CD/cassette stereo. It was imported to the US from Japan by the seller in May 2024, after which the tires, front brake pads, and various fluids were replaced and the air conditioning was recharged. This Stagea is now offered at no reserve in California with import documents and a clean Tennessee title in the seller’s name.",
      "The car is finished in Super Clear Red II and equipped with a rear spoiler, fog lights, power-adjustable mirrors, roof rails, a rear window wiper, black side moldings, and side window deflectors. Paint chips are noted on the front bumper cover and hood, and there are dents on the rear doors. Damage is visible on the rear bumper cover along with a scratch on the front bumper cover and on the passenger-side fender. Paint meter readings from around the car are presented in the gallery below.",
      "Five-spoke 16″ wheels wear 195/65 Seiberling SL101 tires with 2023 date codes. Braking is by four-wheel ABS discs, and the power steering fluid and front brake pads were changed following the seller’s acquisition.",
      "The seating surfaces are upholstered in gray cloth with patterned inserts. The car has woodgrain trim, power windows and locks, automatic climate control, and a factory CD/cassette stereo. The air conditioning was recharged in preparation for the sale. There is a burn mark on the driver seat upholstery.",
      "The digital odometer indicates 160k kilometers (~99k miles), approximately 700 of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The naturally aspirated 2.5L DOHC RB25DE inline-six was factory rated at 200 horsepower. The coolant, engine oil, and air filter reportedly were replaced following the seller’s acquisition. Compression test results and spark plug photos are presented in the gallery.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels via a four-speed automatic transmission. The transmission and rear axle lubricants were changed in preparation for the sale.",
      "The car has not been inspected by the California Bureau of Automotive Repair and it has not passed a California smog test."

    "description": [
      "This dune buggy was assembled circa 1971 using one of approximately 50 Thunder Bug fiberglass bodies designed and produced by Clay Diekmann and Tony Vierra of Bugformance in Sunnyvale, California. The car was reportedly placed in storage from 1982 until its acquisition by the seller in March 2024. Subsequent work is said to have included an oil change, a valve adjustment, a fuel tank flush, and replacement of the fuel pump, filter, sender, spark plugs, and steering damper as well as the brake shoes, hoses, master cylinder, and wheel cylinders. The body is finished in orange metal flake gelcoat with black sides and is mounted to a modified Volkswagen Beetle chassis, which is fitted with an air-cooled 1.6L Type 3 flat-four paired with a four-speed manual transaxle. Additional details include a white convertible soft top, a roll bar, staggered diameter steel wheels, Eelco flip-up fuel cap, Dietz headlight housings, front and rear lap belts, and dual Solex carburetors. This dune buggy is now offered with a clean California title in the seller’s name describing it as a 1971 SPCN.",
      "The fiberglass body is mounted to a modified Volkswagen chassis and finished in orange metal flake gelcoat with black sides and a white convertible soft top. Additional exterior details include an Eelco flip-up fuel cap, Dietz headlight housings, a left side-view mirror, and chrome taillight housings as well as a “Keep On Truckin” license plate frame, a De Anza College parking sticker, and Thunder Bug badging. Images detailing the condition of the exterior are presented in the gallery below.",
      "The 14″ and 15″ steel wheels wear chrome VW-stamped hubcaps and are mounted with older Goodyear Polyglas tires up front and Pos-A-Traction Stagger Block rubber out back. Per the seller, a replacement steering damper was fitted and the drum brakes were serviced with replacement of the shoes, hoses, master cylinder, and wheel cylinders in 2024.",
      "Inside, a pair of sliding and tilting fixed-back bucket seats trimmed in black vinyl have been fitted and are joined by a color-coordinated rear bench seat. Interior elements include a three-spoke steering wheel, front and rear lap belts, a foot-operated high/low-beam switch, and a roll bar.",
      "Instrumentation includes 90-mph VDO speedometer, a tachometer, and readouts for fuel level and amperage. The five-digit mechanical odometer shows 63k miles.",
      "The air-cooled 1.6L “Pancake” flat-four was reportedly sourced from a Type 3 model and is equipped with dual exhaust and Solex carburetors. The buggy utilizes a 6-volt electrical system, and the seller notes the fuel tank was flushed, and oil change and valve adjustment were performed, and the fuel pump, filter, sender, and spark plugs were replaced in 2024. Per the seller, the carburetors require tuning.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a four-speed manual transaxle. A rear skid plate is fitted. Corrosion and seems where the chassis was shortened are visible.",
      "The chassis number 115187669 shown above is consistent with a 1965 Volkswagen Beetle and matches the VIN on the current California title, which describes the car as a 1971 SPCN. The car is registered as Planned Non-Operation (PNO) in the state of California."

      "This 1959 Alfa Romeo Giulietta Spider was refurbished under previous ownership with work involving refinishing the body in blue, refreshing the interior in tan leather, and installing a replacement 2.0L twin-cam inline-four and five-speed manual transmission. The car was acquired by the seller on BaT in January 2022, and it features dual Weber carburetors, 15″ Panasport-style wheels, front disc brakes, Koni shocks, a Nardi steering wheel, and Imasaf exhaust components. This Giulietta spider is now offered with a removed roll bar, service records, and a clean Illinois title in the seller’s name.",
      "The Giulietta was introduced at the 1954 Turin Auto Show with the Bertone-designed Sprint 2+2 coupe. The two-seat Spider was revealed the following year with bodywork by Pinin Farina. This example is said to have been stripped to bare metal and repainted in its current Dutch Blue as part of the refurbishment. Exterior details include chrome bumpers, dual side mirrors, bright trim, and a single exhaust outlet with a polished finisher. The car does not have a top, though a tonneau cover will accompany the sale.",
      "Silver-finished 15″ Panasport-style wheels are wrapped in 185/60 Pirelli P4 tires, as is a matching spare wheel located in the trunk compartment. The suspension is reportedly fitted with Koni shocks, and braking power is provided by front discs and rear drums.",
      "The reupholstered cabin features low-back bucket seats reportedly trimmed in Marrone Cuoio leather and fitted with latch-and-link lap belts. A black dash pad tops the body-colored metal dashboard, while rubber linings and Coco floor mats cover the black carpets. A radio blanking plate has been fitted in the dash. The previously-installed roll bar will accompany the vehicle.",
      "The Nardi steering wheel frames a 7k-rpm tachometer with an inset oil pressure gauge as well as a 120-mph speedometer and a combination gauge for oil temperature, water temperature, and fuel level. The five-digit odometer shows 2,800 miles, which is said to reflect the distance traveled since completion of the refurbishment. Approximately 500 miles have been added by the seller, and total mileage is unknown.",
      "The replacement 2.0-liter inline-four features dual Weber carburetors and is said to have been rebuilt under previous ownership. Additional work is noted to have involved installing a custom air intake manifold and engine mounts as well as overhauling the carburetors. An oil change was performed in May 2024."

Additional equipment includes a two-up seat, adjustable handlebars, Borrani alloy rims, a four-leading-shoe front drum brake, a driveshaft, and both side and center stands. This V7 Sport is now offered with spare parts, owner’s literature, and a clean Oregon title in the owner’s name.",

The fuel tank was internally cleaned with Evapo-Rust in preparation for the sale. Equipment includes a stepped two-up seat, bar-end mirrors, a chrome headlight bucket, and both side and center stands.",

Japanese-style switchgear was fitted under previous ownership along with custom front turn-signal fork brackets and a Bosch quartz halogen headlight. The headlight bucket and rim were not replaced.",
      "The longitudinally mounted 748cc V-twin was factory rated at 70 horsepower and features a gear-driven camshaft and an alternator located at the front of the crankshaft. It has been modified with a Dyna electronic ignition module, Dyna coils, K&N air filters, a Shorai battery, and Silentium “shark gill” silencers. The oil was changed in preparation for the sale.",

      "This 2001 Honda RVT1000R RC51 is powered by a fuel-injected 999cc DOHC V-twin mated to a six-speed transmission, and the bike is finished in red and metallic silver with black accents. Features include a black-finished twin-spar frame, electronic fuel injection, adjustable Showa suspension, triple Nissin disc brakes, six-spoke 17″ alloy wheels, side-mounted radiators, separate rider and passenger seats, and a side stand. This RC51 is now offered at no reserve by the selling dealer with a clean Idaho title.",
      "The fully faired bodywork is finished in red and silver metallic with black accents and is mounted over a brushed aluminum twin-spar frame. The bike has been equipped with an aftermarket rider seat and windscreen, and additional equipment includes a passenger pillion, a side stand, the stock license place bracket, and fairing-mounted mirrors.",
      "Black-finished 17″ cast-alloy wheels are wrapped in ZR-rated Continental tires measuring 120/70 up front and 190/50 out back. The seller states that the tires should be replaced due to age. Adjustable suspension consists of an inverted 43mm Honda Multi-Action System (HMAS) cartridge fork as well as a Pro-Link piggyback monoshock mounted to the aluminum swingarm. Stopping power is provided by gold-finished Nissin four-piston calipers and dual 320mm floating rotors up front in addition to a single-piston Nissin caliper and a 220mm disc out back.",
      "Clip-on handlebars are mounted below the upper triple clamp. The digital instrument panel contains a speedometer and an arcing digital tachometer with a 10k-rpm redline as well as a row of indicator lights for fuel-injection malfunction, low fuel level, high beam, neutral gear indication, turn signals, high coolant temperature, and low oil pressure. The digital odometer indicates 13k miles, approximately 150 of which were ridden by the seller.",
      "The liquid-cooled 999cc DOHC V-twin was factory rated at 136 horsepower and features forged engine hangers, dual 62mm throttle bodies, two fuel injectors per cylinder, dual side-mounted radiators, digital ignition, and a two-into-one-into-two exhaust system. Work in April 2024 included replacing the fuel pump and filter, bleeding the clutch and brakes, and changing the oil.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheel through a multi-disc wet clutch, a six-speed transmission, and a drive chain."

      "This 1989 Ford Mustang LX notchback is said to have been initially commissioned as a Florida Highway Patrol vehicle and was modified for track duty by Racer Walsh of Jacksonville, Florida. The car is powered by a replacement 302ci V8 that is equipped with updated tuning, GT40-specification heads, a Holley carburetor, an Edelbrock intake manifold, and thermally-wrapped headers, and power is sent to the rear wheels through a Super Duty T5 five-speed manual transmission and a 9″ rear end with a limited-slip differential and 31-spline axles. It is finished in blue and yellow, and the race-prepped cabin is fitted with a roll cage, a fire-suppression system, and a fixed-back racing seat with a safety harness. The car appeared in the December 1996 issue of Ford High Performance, and it was acquired by the current owner in 2016. This Fox-body Mustang race car is offered on dealer consignment in Washington state at no reserve with spare parts, records, and a bill of sale.",
      "The car is finished in blue and yellow with sponsor graphics and #9 decals. The hood and doors are secured by pins, and damage on the fenders and rear quarter panels are displayed in the gallery.",
      "Silver ROH 16×8″ wheels are mounted with 255/50 BFGoodrich g-Force Sport Comp 2 tires. The car rides on a modified suspension with Koni dampers, adjustable spring mounts, upsized sway bars, a Griggs torque arm, and a fabricated panhard rod. Stopping power is provided by four-wheel discs with braided stainless-steel lines.",
      "The race-prepped cabin is equipped with a roll cage with door bars and driver’s window nets, and the fixed-back racing seat is fitted with a Speedway Motors harness. A fire extinguisher and fire-suppression system are installed along with auxiliary switchgear on the transmission tunnel. A fuel cell is mounted in the trunk.",
      "The Grant GT steering wheel frames a custom dashboard fascia with a tachometer and readouts for voltage, oil pressure, water temperature, oil temperature, and fuel pressure. Gauges for front and rear brake pressure are mounted on the transmission tunnel. No odometer is present, total mileage is unknown.",
      "The replacement 302ci V8 is equipped with GT40 cylinder heads, revised engine tuning, and a 600-cfm Holley carburetor atop an Edelbrock intake manifold. A Mallory distributor and MSD ignition components provide spark, and further equipment includes a Mishimoto radiator, an electric fan, and a Holley electric fuel pump. Thermally-wrapped headers feed a dual exhaust system with an H-pipe midsection.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a Tremec “Super Duty” T5 five-speed manual transmission and a 9″ rear end with a limited-slip differential, 31-spline axles, and 3.55:1 gears, according to the seller.",
      "Historical photos of the car are provided in the gallery, and it was featured in the December 1996 issue of Ford High Performance. Spare parts, records, and a spare set of wheels and tires are included in the sale.",
      "The Carfax report for this vehicle lists no entries."

Modifications performed by Shelby American included the installation of a Kenne Bell supercharger and Baer cross-drilled and slotted disc brakes in addition to forged 20″ Shelby Alcoa wheels, Super Snake matte black stripes, carbon-fiber exterior trim, side and quarter window scoops, and a fiberglass hood with a scoop and pins. The cabin is outfitted with a Shaker 1000 audio system, an in-dash CD changer, a short-throw shifter, Shelby-branded AutoMeter instrumentation, and a power-adjustable driver’s seat. This Super Snake has 2,200 miles and is now offered on dealer consignment with an accident-free Carfax report, a Shelby American build invoice, and a clean Florida title in the current owner’s name.",

Additional exterior details include a fiberglass hood with a scoop and pins as well as black grille inserts, fog lights, side and quarter window scoops, a rear decklid spoiler, sequential taillights, and Shelby trunk lid lettering.",
      "Forged 20″ Shelby Alcoa wheels are wrapped in 255/35 front and 275/35 rear Pirelli P Zero tires. Braking is handled by cross-drilled and slotted discs at all four corners with blue-finished Shelby Baer six-piston front calipers. The car is also equipped with brake ducts as well as a front strut tower brace and Ford/Tokico dampers.",
      "The front bucket seats and contoured rear seat are upholstered in black leather joined by a color-coordinated center console lid and door panels. The seat backs and center console lid feature embroidered Super Snake logos while interior appointments include a power-adjustable driver seat, air conditioning, cruise control, a short-throw shifter with a white Shelby knob, and a Shaker 1000 audio system with an in-dash six-disc CD changer.",
      "The leather-wrapped steering wheel fronts a 160-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 6k-rpm redline as well as gauges for fuel level, boost pressure, coolant temperature, and oil pressure. Caroll Shelby-signature carbon-fiber AutoMeter Ultra-Lite instruments for boost pressure, fuel pressure, and oil pressure are mounted atop the dash. The digital odometer indicates 2,200 miles.",
      "The 5.4-liter V8 is equipped with a polished Kenne Bell supercharger and cold air intake as well as black-finished aluminum fluid reservoirs with billet caps. An oil change was most recently performed in 2023.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a Tremec six-speed manual transmission and a 3.73:1 limited-slip differential. A Borla cat-back exhaust system has been fitted.",
      "The Carfax report is free of accidents or other damage and lists open recalls."

      "This 1964 Pontiac Catalina 2+2 is a tw0-door sports coupe that was first delivered to Blumer Motors of Kelso, Washington. The car is refinished in white over black vinyl upholstery and is powered by a 421ci V8 mated to a three-speed automatic transmission. Equipment includes eight-lug 14″ wheels, a dual exhaust system, a center console, a heater, and a push-button AM radio. An engine rebuild was completed in 2017, and the seller acquired the car in 2023. This Catalina 2+2 is now offered with a build sheet, Pontiac Historical Services documents, a Protect-O-Plate, vehicle literature, and a clean Oregon title in the seller’s name.",
      "The Sports Coupe was the pillarless version of the Catalina. This example left the factory finished in Cameo Ivory and was refinished approximately 12 years ago under previous ownership.",
      "Eight-lug 14″ wheels wear 225/70 BFGoodrich Radial T/A white-letter tires. Braking is provided by four-wheel drums.",
      "The cabin features front bucket seats and a rear bench upholstered in black vinyl. Appointments include a center console, a heater, a push-button AM radio, and front lap belts. The driver’s seat bottom, the trunk mat, and the door and trunk seals are said to have been replaced, and a rust repair in the trunk is noted.",
      "The two-spoke steering wheel features a bright horn ring and sits ahead of a tachometer, a horizontal-sweep 120-mph speedometer, and gauges for battery status and fuel level. A manifold vacuum gauge sits ahead of the center console. The five-digit mechanical odometer shows 4,900 miles, approximately 700 of which were added under current ownership. Total mileage is unknown.",
      "The car is powered by a 421ci V8 equipped with a four-barrel carburetor, and an engine rebuild completed in 2017 that involved boring the block .020″ over and replacing the pistons, camshaft, cam bearings, and timing set.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a three-speed Hydra-Matic automatic transmission. Aftermarket mufflers are fitted.",
      "Build paperwork shows equipment and options. Pontiac Historical Society documentation, a Protect-O-Plate, and vehicle literature are also included in the sale."

      "This 2022 Lamborghini Aventador LP780-4 is one of approximately 250 Ultimae roadster examples built to commemorate the final year of Aventador production. It was ordered new by the seller through Lamborghini’s Ad Personam program and was specified in Blu Emera matte over Blu Delphinus upholstery. Power is delivered by a 6.5-liter V12 linked to a seven-speed ISR automated manual transmission and a Haldex all-wheel-drive system. Equipment includes carbon-fiber removable roof panels, carbon-ceramic brakes, 20” and 21” forged wheels, a suspension lift system, heated power-adjustable seats, a Sensonum sound system, and carbon-fiber interior and exterior trim. This LP780-4 Ultimae roadster has 710 miles and is now offered with a digital window sticker, the owner’s manual, a battery tender, a clean Carfax report, and a clean California title.",
      "The Ultimae edition was announced in July 2021 as the final version of the Aventador. Production was limited to 350 coupes and 250 roadsters, although an additional 15 cars were produced by Lamborghini in response to the sinking of a cargo vessel in March 2022. This example is finished in Blu Emera, a $23,700 matte color selection.",
      "Exterior features include optional carbon-fiber removable roof panels, bi-xenon headlights with washers, rear fog lights, heated and power-folding mirrors, and the Aerodinamica Lamborghini Attiva 2.0 active front air intake and aero-channel system.",
      "Forged 20″ and 21″ Leirion wheels are mounted with 255/30 front and 355/25 rear Pirelli P Zero Corsa tires. The car is equipped with magnetic push-rod suspension, Electronic Stability Control (ESC), and a front-axle suspension lift system. Stopping power is provided by yellow-painted multi-piston calipers over carbon-ceramic rotors at all four corners.",
      "The cockpit is upholstered in Ad Personam Blu Delphinus with Giallo stitching covering the seats, dashboard, pillars, and center console. Features include heated power-adjustable seats, carbon-fiber door panels and trim, Giallo Taurus seatbelts, an Ultimae plaque near the A-pillar, a Lamborghini infotainment system, a Lamborghini Sensonum sound system, and automatic climate control.",
      "The Alcantara-wrapped multi-function steering wheel frames a TFT LCD digital gauge cluster with a variable-redline tachometer, speed and fuel readouts, and auxiliary gauges for oil temperature and oil pressure. The digital odometer indicates 710 miles, all of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The 6.5-liter V12 was fitted with titanium intake valves in Ultimae specification to achieve a factory-rated output of 769 horsepower and 531 lb-ft of torque, which is sent to all four wheels through a seven-speed single-clutch ISR automated manual transmission and a Haldex all-wheel-drive system with a limited-slip rear differential.",
      "A digital copy of the window sticker shows initial delivery to Luxury Cars Los Gatos in California, and lists factory equipment, colors, and a total suggested retail price of $655,242.",
      "The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage."

      "This 2006 Ford GT was purchased by the seller on BaT in April 2022, and it has since spent time on display at the Jax Sports Car Museum in Jacksonville, Florida. It is finished in Mark IV Red over Ebony leather and was factory-optioned with forged aluminum BBS wheels, red-finished brake calipers, and painted white stripes. Power is provided by a supercharged 5.4-liter V8 linked with a six-speed manual gearbox and a helical limited-slip differential. Additional equipment includes a Ford short-shift kit, Ford Racing mufflers, Brembo brakes, HID headlights, a front splitter, and a rear diffuser. This Ford GT has 6k miles and is now offered with service records, a spare McIntosh stereo, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Florida title in the name of the seller’s LLC.",
      "The GT took inspiration from the GT40 racing cars of the 1960s and features an extruded-aluminum space frame, roll-bonded floors, and aluminum body panels. This example is one of 348 finished in Mark IV Red for the model year and features optional over-the-top white stripes and Ford GT graphics as well as HID headlights, fog lights, side air intakes, a vented hood, a front splitter, a rear diffuser, and a dual center-exit exhaust system. White Ford GT side graphics have been installed since the previous auction, and the seller states that paint correction was performed before a ceramic coating was applied during their ownership.",
      "Factory-optional BBS forged lightweight aluminum wheels measure 18” up front and 19” out back and are mounted with 235/45 front and 315/40 rear Goodyear Eagle F1 Supercar tires. The Brembo braking system features optional red-painted four-piston monoblock calipers with cross-drilled and ventilated rotors that measure 14” up front and 13.2” out back. A brake fluid flush was performed in preparation for the sale.",
      "The cockpit is trimmed in Ebony leather, and rubber mats cover bare aluminum floors. Manually adjusted seats were designed by Sparco and feature carbon-fiber shells with GT40-style ventilation grommets and harness slots. The console on the center tunnel houses rotary climate controls, and amenities include air conditioning, remote keyless entry, and push-button ignition. The seller states that a Ford short-shift kit is installed, and a McIntosh stereo is also included in the sale. Airbag recalls were performed in June 2022.",
      "The leather-wrapped steering wheel is affixed to a tilting and telescoping column ahead of the GT40-inspired instrument array consisting of a central tachometer with a 6,500-rpm redline and an offset 220-mph speedometer. The seller notes imperfections in the steering wheel center emblem. Toggle-switch controls are positioned under additional gauges for coolant temperature, oil pressure, voltage, boost, and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 6k miles, approximately 400 of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The mid-mounted 5.4-liter DOHC V8 features an aluminum block, cylinder heads, and pistons in addition to a Lysholm screw-type supercharger, a dry-sump lubrication system, and a water-to-air intercooler. Factory-rated output was 550 horsepower and 500 lb-ft of torque. Work in May 2024 included an oil change and a coolant flush.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a Ricardo six-speed manual transaxle and a helical limited-slip differential. The seller notes that Ford Racing mufflers are installed, and a transaxle fluid flush was performed in May 2024.",
      "The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage."

    "description": [
      "This 1970 Ferrari Dino 246 GT was built for the European market and is one of approximately 355 L-Series examples produced between June 1969 and October 1970. Completed on January 15th, 1970, this example was reportedly delivered new in Italy and was later imported to the US from South Africa by the selling dealer in 2023. It has been repainted in Rosso Chiaro over Nero vinyl and is powered by a 2.4-liter V6 equipped with triple Weber carburetors and mated to a five-speed manual transaxle. Equipment includes four-wheel ventilated disc brakes, 14” Cromodora alloy wheels with knock-off hubs, and a heater. This L-Series 246 is now offered in Mount Kisco, New York with a Dino Compendium report, service records, and a clean Montana title.",
      "The L-Series 246 GT debuted at the Geneva Motor Show in 1969 as the successor to the 206 GT of 1967 to 1969. Like its predecessor, it featured an aluminum hood, decklid, and doors as well as a push-button trunk latch and thinner chrome bumpers compared to later 246 GTs.",
      "The Scaglietti-built bodywork on this example was delivered from the factory in Giallo Fly, and it was repainted in its current color of Rosso Chiaro in the 1980s and again in the 2000s. European-market lighting includes flush front turn signal lenses, small round signal repeaters on the front fenders, amber rear turn signals, and the absence of rectangular side and rear reflectors. The lower nose was repaired and refinished and the front bumper brackets replaced in 2018, at which time the rear bumpers were repaired and rechromed.",
      "The 14” Cromodora alloy wheels feature three-eared knock-off covers over a center-locking hub and are mounted with Michelin XWX tires measuring 205/70. A matching spare wheel is mounted in the front trunk. The suspension incorporates unequal-length A-arms, coilover shock absorbers, and anti-roll bars at front and rear. Stopping power is provided by power-assisted ventilated disc brakes all around.",
      "The cabin houses fixed-back bucket seats that tilt on their bases and are trimmed in Nero vinyl with color-matched upholstery over the door panels and console. Black carpets line the floors, and additional features include “mouse-fur” dash trim, a heater, a gated shifter, a passenger-side footrest, a sill-mounted passenger grab handle, and headrests mounted to the rear bulkhead.",
      "The leather-trimmed steering wheel features a Dino horn button and frames Dino-branded Veglia Borletti instrumentation including a 270-km/h speedometer, a tachometer with a 7,750-rpm redline, an analog clock, and auxiliary gauges for oil temperature, coolant temperature, oil pressure, fuel level, and amperage. The five-digit odometer shows 55k kilometers (~34k miles), less than 100 of which were added by the selling dealer.",
      "The mid-mounted 2.4-liter Tipo 135CS V6 features a 65° angle between cylinder banks, dual overhead camshafts on each bank, Magneti Marelli ignition, and a trio of two-barrel Weber carburetors. Power is sent to the rear wheels via a five-speed manual transaxle. Work in 2017 included tightening the cylinder heads, resetting the valve tappets, overhauling the carburetors and alternator, and cleaning the fuel system. The thermostat and housing were replaced in 2018.",
      "The Matthias Bartz Dino Compendium report lists the factory colors and options as well as a production date of January 15, 1970 and the known ownership history.",
      "Chassis number *00572* is shown above, and the car is titled using VIN DINO246GT00572."

The interior is trimmed in gray cloth and vinyl and features front and rear bench seating as well as fold-away middle seats and rear controls for the radio and air conditioning. An Edelbrock carburetor has been installed along with a replacement dual exhaust system and an electric windshield wiper motor. This Fleetwood limousine was inherited by the seller in 2019 and is now offered with refurbishment records and photos as well as a clean Colorado title in the seller’s name.",

      "The 120-mph speedometer is accompanied by an analog clock and a fuel gauge, and the seller notes a crack on the fuel-gauge lens. The seller notes that the five-digit odometer does not work, and shows 39k miles, although total mileage is unknown.",
      "The 364 V8 was rebuilt in 2002 and is topped with an Edelbrock carburetor. The radiator was overhauled during the refurbishment.",

    "description": [
      "This 1929 Ford Model A cabriolet was built into a street rod in the mid-1990s and is powered by a fuel-injected 5.7-liter LT1 V8. The engine is backed by a 700R4 automatic transmission, and other highlights of the build include full fenders, four-wheel independent suspension, four-wheel disc brakes, and 15″ wheels. The cabin is upholstered in maroon and cream cloth and features a tilt steering column, floor shifter, Alpine cassette stereo, and VDO gauges. The car remained with its previous owner for approximately 30 years and was driven little during that time before being selling dealer in 2024. This Model A is now offered with a clean Ohio title.",
      "The cabriolet body is steel and is equipped with steel fenders, running boards, and a hood top. Additional features include front and rear bumpers, cowl-mounted turn signals, dual sideview mirrors, and a black soft top. The seller notes that the doors close but are not flush with the body.",
      "Steel 15” wheels wear beauty rings and hubcaps along with staggered-width Cooper tires. Fully independent suspension is Mustang II style up front and Jaguar style out back, and braking is provided by vented discs and inboard solid discs, respectively. Adjustable coilovers are fitted all around.",
      "Bench seating is upholstered in cream cloth and was installed in 2002. The door and side panels are trimmed in maroon cloth, and interior appointments include a floor shifter and an Alpine cassette stereo. The cabin is also equipped with power windows, though the seller notes that they are not functional.",
      "A three-spoke steering wheel is mounted on the tilting column, and an 8k-rpm Auto Gage tachometer is also mounted to the column. VDO instrumentation in the dash includes a 120-mph speedometer along with gauges for voltage, fuel level, water temperature, and oil pressure. The odometer shows 11k miles, just a handful of which were added by the selling dealer. The previous owner reportedly drove the car little, adding just 500 miles while attending local shows over a 30-year period.",
      "The injected LT1 V8 was reportedly sourced from a Corvette and was installed circa 1995 as part of the build. The alternator was replaced in November 2023.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a 700R4 four-speed automatic transmission. The car is equipped with a dual exhaust system, and the fuel tank and battery are located in the truck as pictured in the gallery."

      "This 1980 Chevrolet K5 Blazer Silverado was fitted with a replacement 350ci V8 under previous ownership and refinished in orange metallic following the seller’s 2023 acquisition. Equipment includes a three-speed automatic transmission, an NP205 dual-range transfer case, a 12-bolt limited-slip rear axle, power steering, front disc brakes, 15″ Rally wheels, a removable black hardtop, tan cloth upholstery, air conditioning, power windows and locks, and a Kenwood Bluetooth stereo. This K5 Blazer is offered with service records, an owner’s manual, and a clean Colorado title in the seller’s name.",
      "The seller states truck was refinished in orange metallic under current ownership, and rust repairs were performed on the floorboards before the truck was refinished. Additional work involved installing round headlights and a windshield with an antenna as well as replacing the chrome bumpers, badges, folding side mirrors, door handles, and door and tailgate locks that have been keyed alike. Exterior details include a removable fiberglass hardtop with sliding side windows that has been coated in a textured black material as well as an electric rear window and a 2″ receiver hitch.",
      "The 15″ Rally wheels have been refinished and are mounted with 32×11.5″ BFGoodrich All-Terrain T/A KO2 tires. A covered spare is housed in the rear cargo area. Monroe shock absorbers were installed under current ownership and the truck is further equipped with power steering and Warn manually locking front hubs. Braking is handled by front discs and rear drums.",
      "The front bucket seats and folding rear bench are trimmed in tan cloth with vinyl sides and backing. The carpeting was replaced under current ownership and appointments include air conditioning, power windows and locks, and a Kenwood Bluetooth stereo. The cruise control module has been removed though the switch is retained.",
      "The two-spoke steering wheel is mounted to a tilting column and frames an 85-mph speedometer and gauges for fuel level, voltage, oil pressure, and coolant temperature. The five-digit odometer shows 98k miles, approximately 1k of which were added under current ownership.",
      "A replacement 350ci V8 was installed in 2005 and the battery was replaced under current ownership. The carburetor was adjusted and the truck passed a Colorado emissions test in March 2023. The seller notes that the smog equipment and catalytic converter are retained.",
      "Power is sent to the rear or all four wheels through a TH350 three-speed automatic transmission, an NP205 dual-range transfer case, and a 12-bolt limited-slip rear axle with 3.73:1 gearing. The transmission and torque converter were rebuilt in 2021. The truck is equipped with a transmission oil cooler and the muffler was replaced under current ownership."

      "This 1962 MG MGA Mk II roadster was acquired by the seller in 2010 following refurbishment work carried out under previous ownership. Finished in white over red vinyl, the car is powered by a 1,622cc inline-four linked with a four-speed manual transmission. It is equipped with a black soft top, removable sliding windows, 15″ knock-off wire wheels, front disc brakes, and a rear luggage rack with a wicker basket. Service performed within the last five years is said to have included overhauling the dual SU carburetors and replacing the radiator, water pump, and rear wheel bearings as well as changing the brake master cylinder, front brake pads, rear brake shoes, and shock absorbers. This MGA roadster is offered at no reserve with manufacturer’s literature, recent service records, car show trophies, a car cover, a red tonneau cover and top boot, and Maine registration in the seller’s name.",
      "The body was repainted white in approximately 2000. Equipment includes a black soft top, a left-side mirror, removable sliding windows, and a rear luggage rack with a wicker basket. The seller notes wear on the soft top, and photos showing cracked paint and other blemishes can be viewed in the gallery below. The photos and videos were taken in September 2023.",
      "Bright 15″ knock-off wire wheels were mounted with 165-series Michelin XZX tires in 2020. Additional work at that time is said to have included changing the shock absorbers and rear wheel bearings as well as replacing the brake master cylinder, front pads, and rear shoes.",
      "The bucket seats are trimmed in red vinyl and complemented by a color-coordinated dashboard, center armrest, and door panels. Black carpeting lines the floors, and a fire extinguisher is mounted beneath the dash along with an inoperative Kenwood stereo and aftermarket speakers.",
      "The banjo-style steering wheel fronts Jaeger instrumentation consisting of a 120-mph speedometer, a tachometer, an analog clock, and supplementary gauges. The seller notes that the fuel level gauge is inaccurate. The five-digit odometer shows 99k miles, approximately 2,500 of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The 1,622cc inline-four sends power to the rear wheels through a four-speed manual gearbox. The radiator, water pump, and coolant hoses were replaced in October 2018, while the dual SU carburetors were reportedly rebuilt in July 2020.",
      "Photos showing corrosion and fluid seepage on various underbody components can be viewed in the gallery below.",
      "Manufacturer’s literature, recent service records, car show trophies, wing windows, tinted visors, and a car cover will accompany the car along with a red top boot and tonneau cover.",
      "The car does not have a title, as it is registered in a state that does not issue titles for vehicles of its age. It is being sold on its Maine registration."

      "This 1971 Honda CB350 was purchased by the seller in 2008, and refurbishment work carried out in 2015 included refinishing and resealing its 325cc parallel twin, rebuilding the twin Keihin carburetors, and repainting the frame. The fuel tank was internally coated, and the piston rings, cam-chain tensioner, petcock, and control cables were replaced. Finished in Candy Gold, the bike also received replacement tires in 2018 and a battery, spark-plug caps, and muffler baffles in 2023. It is further equipped with a five-speed transmission, both kick and electric starters, and 18″ wire-spoke wheels along with drum brakes, preload-adjustable shocks, both center and side stands, and a black bench seat. This CB350 is now offered at no reserve with a tool kit and a clean Ohio title in the seller’s name.",
      "The Candy Gold bodywork was removed in 2015 so that the single-downtube steel frame could refinished in black along with the battery box, fork yokes, and air-cleaner case. The 3.2-gallon fuel tank was lined with POR-15, and much of the hardware was replated. Additional bike features include street lighting with turn signals as well as a black vinyl-upholstered two-up seat, folding passenger foot pegs, and both center and side stands. The seller notes some pitting in the brightwork, and photos showing a dent in the headlight bezel, chipped paint and graphics, and a drilled hole in the top of the rear fender are provided in the gallery below.",
      "Wire-spoke wheels with 18″ chromed-steel rims and drum-brake hubs were mounted with IRC GS-11 tires and replacement tubes in 2018. Suspension consists of a telescopic fork that was resealed in 2015 as well as dual shrouded and preload-adjustable shocks mounted to the swingarm.",
      "The chrome handlebar carries dual mirrors and levers with replacement cables, and instrumentation just ahead consists of a green-dial Nippon Seiki 110-mph speedometer and a matching tachometer with a 9,500-rpm redline. The five-digit odometer shows 8k miles, approximately 700 of which were ridden under current ownership.",
      "The 325cc parallel twin was factory rated at 34 horsepower and is equipped with both kick and electric starters, dual Keihin carburetors, and a chrome dual exhaust system with “HM317” stampings. The 2015 refurbishment included bead-blasting and repainting the crankcase and side covers, removing carbon deposits, and honing the cylinders along with rebuilding the carburetors and reassembling the engine using a replacement camshaft-chain tensioner, piston rings, and seals and gaskets. The petcock and fuel lines were also replaced, and the header-mounting rings were re-chromed. In 2023, the battery, muffler baffles, and spark-plug caps were replaced.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheel through a five-speed transmission and a drive chain.",

The seller acquired the car out of Ohio on BaT in April 2023 and proceeded to overhaul the air conditioning system and replace the valve cover gasket, tires, and mounts for the engine and transmission. Finished in black, the car is equipped with a UUC stainless-steel exhaust, Schrick camshafts, Turner Motorsport ECU tuning software, 17″ OZ Racing wheels, lowering springs, Dinan sway bars, HID projector-beam headlights, and a sunroof. The interior is appointed with power-adjustable front seats upholstered in gray leather as well as an M Tech II steering wheel, an onboard computer, and a cooled compartment in the rear. This S38B38-powered E24 M6 shows 176k chassis miles and is now offered in California with a car cover, service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Washington title in the seller’s name.",
      "The two-door body is finished in black and features a front spoiler with integrated fog lights as well as a sunroof, HID projector-beam headlights, bright trim, a power antenna, a decklid spoiler, and twin center-exit exhaust outlets. Chipped paint and dents on various body panels are shown in the gallery, and the red and blue bodyside pinstripes are faded. Corrosion at the base of the windshield is noted by the seller. Scuffs on the right front fender were touched up, the side mirror caps were repainted, and faded paint on the spoiler was repaired under current ownership.",
      "The 17″ silver-finished OZ Racing Mito multi-piece wheels were mounted with 245/45 Continental ExtremeContact DWS06 tires in March 2024. Lowering springs and Dinan sway bars have been installed and braking is handled by four-wheel discs, the rear components of which are said to have been sourced from an E34 540i. A brake fluid flush was performed in preparation for the sale.",
      "The power-adjustable front seats are believed to have been reupholstered in gray leather, which extends to the rear bench and portions of the door panels. Amenities include cruise control, on onboard computer, a cooled compartment in the rear, and power-operated windows, mirrors, and locks. The air conditioning system was overhauled with a replacement compressor, lines, blower motor, and heater fan as well as a recharge with R134a refrigerant following the seller’s acquisition. The rear sunshade is inoperative and the seller notes that the right-front seat tilt cover is missing a retaining screw. A JVC head unit and an aftermarket amplifier have been installed, however, their functionality has not been verified by the seller.",
      "The M Tech II steering wheel frames a tachometer with a 6,500-rpm redline as well as a 170-mph speedometer and gauges for coolant temperature and fuel level. The six-digit mechanical odometer shows 176k chassis miles, approximately 100 miles were added by the seller. Areas of wear are noted on the steering wheel.",
      "A 3.8-liter S38B38 inline-six sourced from a European-market E34 M5 was installed in August 2003 by Koala Motorsport of Novelty, Ohio. The replacement engine features an aluminum radiator, 280-degree Schrick camshafts, and Bosch Motronic 3.3 engine management software, which is said to have been modified with ECU tuning software from Turner Motorsport. Work following the seller’s acquisition included changing the oil and replacing the valve cover gasket, engine mounts, spark plug tube seals, and the drive belts for the alternator and power steering pump. The results of an April 2024 compression test are provided in the gallery.",
      "Power is delivered to the rear wheels through an E34 M5-sourced six-speed manual transmission, an aftermarket driveshaft, and a differential with 3.77:1 gearing. The transmission and differential received fluid changes in April 2024, and work since has included performing a dry ice cleaning process on the engine bay and underside as well as replacing the transmission mounts and a differential bushing. A UUC stainless-steel exhaust system is installed.",
      "A car cover is included in the sale. Service records will also accompany the car and can be viewed in the gallery.",
      "The Carfax report is free of accidents or other damage.",

      "This 1963 Rupp Grand Prix go-kart is powered by twin McCulloch 7.08ci two-stroke singles with Rev-Grip dry clutches. It was purchased by the seller in 2019 and subsequently refurbished with a metallic blue repaint of the chromoly tubular frame. Hardware was show-chromed, and both engines were reportedly rebuilt. Features include turbine wheels with bright trim rings, a single drum brake, a black vinyl seat, and a chain-driven, fixed-gear rear axle with dual sprockets. This Rupp Grand Prix is now offered at no reserve in Chicago, Illinois, on a bill of sale.",
      "The chromoly tubular frame is said to have been stripped and powder coated in medium blue metallic under current ownership. White pinstripes and a shadowed number 7 have been added to the Nassau panel, which also features a manufacturer’s plate labeled “Grand Prix”. Additional features include a chrome Hoffco front bumper and a polished aluminum floorplan with an under-pedal grip pad.",
      "The 5″ Rupp turbine wheels were stripped and re-chromed, together with the trim rings, and wear replacement Vintage Speed slick tires. The wheel bearings have been replaced, and the steering shaft, tie rod end, and spindles have also been chromed. Stopping power is provided by a rear-mounted 6″ Bendix drum brake.",
      "The three-spoke steering wheel with a black grip fronts a single seat that has been reupholstered in black with white piping and Dart Kart branding. A chrome Chilton fuel tank is mounted behind.",
      "The twin McCulloch MC70 singles were reportedly rebuilt by Bill McCornack during the refurbishment and fitted with replacement pistons, rods, bearings, rings, gaskets, and seals. The engines are equipped with chromed shrouds, Tillotson carburetors, Azusa velocity stacks, and exhaust trumpets with pea shooter-style top plates. Power is sent to the rear axles via rebuilt Rev-Grip dry clutches, drive chains, and a detachable rear axle.",
      "The manufacturer’s plaque affixed to the Nassau panel shows wear and is stamped with serial number 257. The pictured kart stand is not included in the sale."

      "This 1973 Honda XR75 is said to have remained in storage for 39 years before it was refurbished in 2022 with work that included refinishing the bodywork in metallic gray, powder-coating the frame and upswept exhaust, and rebuilding the 72cc SOHC four-stroke single along with the fork, drum brakes, and wheel hubs. Power is delivered to the rear wheel via a four-speed transmission, and the bike is equipped with a black vinyl solo seat, a chrome cross-braced handlebar, a skid plate, a Keihin carburetor, a kick starter, preload-adjustable shocks, and wire-spoke wheels with chrome steel rims. Acquired by the seller in 2023, this XR75 is now offered at no reserve in California for off-road use only with a 2023 inspection report and a bill of sale.",
      "The fuel tank, fenders, and side number plates were refinished in metallic gray with red and white decals as part of the aforementioned refurbishment. The frame was powder-coated black at that time, and the bike is equipped with a black vinyl solo seat, a front number plate, a rear grab bar, a skid plate, spring-loaded serrated foot pegs, and a side stand.",
      "Wire-spoke wheels with chrome steel rims measuring 16″ up front and 14″ out back are mounted with IRC Motocross GS-45Z1 tires. Braking is handled by chrome-finished drum brake hubs, while suspension consists of a consists of a conventional telescopic fork with chrome-finished lowers as well as a pair of preload-adjustable shocks mounted to the swingarm. As part of the refurbishment, the fork, brakes, and wheel hubs were rebuilt.",
      "The chrome-finished cross-braced handlebar is equipped with black-tipped clutch and brake levers as well as a twist-grip throttle and ignition switchgear. The motorcycle is not equipped with an odometer or other instrumentation, therefore true mileage is unknown.",
      "The 72cc SOHC four-stroke single is said to have been rebuilt in 2022. It features a 16mm Keihin carburetor connected to a chrome-finished intake manifold as well as a kick starter and an upswept exhaust system that has been refinished with black powder-coating.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheel through a four-speed transmission and a drive chain.",
      "The motorcycle does not have a title or registration. It is being sold on a bill of sale for off-road use only."

    "description": [
      "This 1978 Ducati 900SS is powered by an 864cc L-twin that features a desmodromic valvetrain, bevel-gear-driven overhead camshafts, and a pair of Dell’Orto PHF carburetors. The bike is finished in silver with blue accents, and additional equipment includes a five-speed transmission, triple disc brakes, Borrani alloy rims, Marzocchi suspension, a Bosch ignition, a Tommaselli throttle, and Conti megaphone mufflers in addition to a half-fairing, a racing-style seat, clip-on handlebars, rear-set foot controls, and a center stand. This 900SS was acquired by the seller circa 2019 and is now offered with a New Hampshire title in the seller’s name.",
      "The bike is finished in silver with blue stripes and 900 Super Sport graphics, and the half-fairing was repainted blue under previous ownership. The black-finished open-cradle steel frame utilizes the engine as a stressed member, and additional features include a 4.75-gallon fuel tank, a clear windscreen, vented side covers, rear-set foot controls, and a racing-style solo seat with a zippered storage compartment and a rear cowl. The rear fender has been removed and the taillight relocated to the rear cowl. Close-up photos in the gallery show chips and cracks along with yellowed decals and rust adjacent to the rear brake master cylinder.",
      "Wire-spoke wheels with Borrani 18″ alloy rims are mounted with older Michelin M45 tires. Marzocchi suspension consists of a 38mm telescopic fork with black sliders as well as a pair of preload-adjustable shocks mounted to the swingarm. Braking is provided by dual 280mm discs up front and a single 229mm disc at the rear. The seller recommends bleeding the front brake and replacing the tires before riding.",
      "Clip-on handlebars carrying cracked Verlicchi grips and a Tommaselli Daytona 2C throttle are secured beneath the top triple clamp. The dash houses a 150-mph Smiths speedometer, a matching tachometer with an 8k-rpm redline, a bank of warning lamps, and a keyed ignition switch. The five-digit odometer shows 10k miles, approximately 500 of which were ridden by the seller.",
      "The 864cc square-case L-twin features a desmodromic valvetrain, bevel-driven overhead camshafts, and a pair of 32mm Dell’Orto PHF carburetors with screened velocity stacks as well as a Bosch electronic ignition, a kick starter, and a chrome dual exhaust system with upswept Conti megaphone mufflers. The carburetors were cleaned and the oil was changed subsequent to the seller’s acquisition of the bike out of long-term storage. A temporary dry-cell battery was installed for the purpose of filming a cold-start video, though the bike is being sold without a battery.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a wet clutch, a five-speed transmission, and a drive chain.",
      "The bike is accompanied by spare parts including an Imola fiberglass fuel tank, Imola racing camshafts, a set of chrome Lafranconi mufflers, a pair of 40mm Dell’Orto PHM carburetors, intake manifolds, air cleaners, a black-finished race exhaust system, factory specialized workshop tools, and various other parts, many of which were collected as part of an unrealized plan by the previous owner to convert the bike into a racer.",
      "The New Hampshire title carries an “Antique Vehicle” brand."

Equipment includes a sunroof, 19″ AMG five-spoke wheels, heated power-adjustable front seats, a Harman Kardon LOGIC7 sound system, a backup camera, and three-zone automatic climate control. This W164 ML550 is now offered by the selling dealer at no reserve with the owner’s manual, a clean Carfax report, and a clean California title.",

      "The 5.5-liter M273 V8 was factory rated at 382 horsepower and 391 lb-ft of torque. Power is delivered to all four wheels through a 7G-Tronic seven-speed automatic transmission and a 4MATIC all-wheel-drive system. An oil change was performed and the timing cover gasket was said to have been replaced in preparation for the sale.",

All examples were finished in Titanium Gray Metallic over Titanium Exclusive Nappa leather, and power comes from a supercharged 5.4-liter V8 paired with a five-speed automatic transmission. The car has been fitted with Lorinser bumpers, fenders, side skirts, a rear spoiler, and a sport exhaust system. Additional features include a sunroof, bi-xenon headlamps with Active Curve Illumination, Parktronic, aftermarket 20″ wheels, heated and ventilated Dynamic front seats, heated rear seats, an Alcantara headliner, four-zone climate control, a Harman Kardon audio system, COMAND with navigation, Keyless Go, and a powered rear-window sunshade. The car was initially sold in California and remained registered in the state prior to the seller’s February 2022 purchase, and it has 26k miles. This C219 CLS55 AMG is now offered with a window sticker, the owner’s manual, a damage-free Carfax report, and a clean Illinois title.",

The car is equipped with an Electronic Stability Program (ESP), speed-sensitive power steering, and Airmatic Dual Control air suspension. Stopping power is provided by perforated and ventilated discs measuring 14.2″ and 13″ front and rear, respectively.",
      "The four-passenger cabin features seating surfaces trimmed in Titanium Exclusive Nappa leather, while Piano black trim accents the dashboard and center console.

      "This 2017 Ford F-150 Raptor SuperCrew pickup remained with the original owner until the selling dealer’s acquisition in 2024. The truck is powered by a twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V6 linked with a 10-speed automatic transmission, a dual-range transfer case, and an electronic locking rear differential. It is finished in Lightning Blue Metallic over black leather upholstery, and options include the Raptor Technology Package, a twin-panel sunroof, a Retrax tonneau cover, Baja Design LED auxiliary lights, a receiver hitch, 17″ wheels, an Alcon big brake kit, heated and ventilated power-adjustable front seats, a Sony sound system, and SYNC 3 with navigation. This F-150 Raptor has 69k miles and is now offered with the owner’s manual, two keys, an accident-free Carfax report, and a clean California title.",
      "The Raptor features widened front and rear fenders compared to the standard F-150, and this example is finished in Lightning Blue Metallic. Exterior equipment includes LED headlights, Baja Design LED auxiliary lights, a heavy-duty front bumper, exposed tow hooks, a twin-panel sunroof, Raptor-branded side steps, a power-sliding rear window, a Retrax tonneau cover, a receiver hitch, remote tailgate release, a spray-in bedliner, and heavy-duty skid plates. Scratches around the body are noted by the seller.",
      "The 17″ wheels are mounted with 315/70 Nitto Ridge Grappler tires. The truck was factory equipped with Fox Racing internal-bypass shocks. An Alcon big brake kit was installed under previous ownership.",
      "The SuperCrew cabin features heated and ventilated power-adjustable front seats upholstered in black leather with Dark Earth Gray accents. Interior amenities include a Sony sound system, cruise control, dual-zone automatic climate control, and SYNC 3 with navigation. The optional Raptor Technology Package added a lane-keeping system, rain-sensing wipers, and Adaptive Cruise Control with Stop-and-Go.",
      "The leather-wrapped multifunction steering wheel features paddle shifters and frames a 140-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 6,200-rpm redline as well as a central configurable LCD screen with auxiliary gauges for oil pressure, coolant temperature, fuel level, and transmission temperature. The digital odometer indicates 69k miles.",
      "The twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter EcoBoost V6 was factory rated at 450 horsepower and 510 lb-ft of torque. A coolant flush was performed in June 2022 and an oil change was carried out in March 2024.",
      "Power is sent to the rear or all four wheels through a 10-speed automatic transmission, a dual-range transfer case, and an electronic locking rear differential. The differential fluid and transfer case fluid were changed in June 2022 and the transmission fluid was changed in November 2023.",
      "The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage and lists at least one open recall."

      "This 1988 Ford Mustang Saleen is #210 of approximately 700 examples modified by Saleen Autosport for the model year, and it shows 68k miles. The car is finished in black with gold stripes over beige cloth upholstery, and it is powered by a 5.0-liter V8 mated to a five-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential. Saleen additions included a rear wing, revised body panels, upgraded suspension and braking components, 16″ basketweave wheels, Flo-Fit front seats, a MOMO steering wheel, and a Hurst shifter. The car was previously sold on BaT in December 2023, and it was acquired six months ago by the selling dealer, who installed a factory-specification Pioneer cassette stereo and serviced the suspension, exhaust, paint, and glass. This Saleen Mustang is offered with Saleen correspondence and literature, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Massachusetts title.",
      "The hatchback body is said to have been refinished circa 2018. Paint correction work was completed in preparation for the sale, and the rear quarter windows were replaced. A Saleen Mustang banner spans the windshield, and a decal showing the car’s Saleen build number “210” is located on the left side of the front bumper.",
      "Five-lug 16″ American Racing/Saleen basketweave wheels were mounted with 225/50 Michelin Pilot Exalto tires under current ownership, and replacement dampers were installed for the Saleen Racecraft suspension, which also has performance-tuned springs, unique strut top bearings, urethane sway bar bushings, and a three-point strut tower brace. Stopping power is provided by four-wheel SVO-type disc brakes.",
      "The Flo-Fit front bucket seats are trimmed in beige cloth, and red Saleen Mustang embroidery accents the color-keyed door panels. Appointments include air conditioning, power windows, locks, and mirrors, and a Pioneer cassette stereo installed by the selling dealer. Steve Saleen’s signature is noted on the center console, retractable cargo cover, and dashboard, which has an area of discoloration on its right side.",
      "The leather-wrapped MOMO steering wheel frames Saleen Mustang-branded instrumentation including a 170-mph speedometer, a tachometer, and auxiliary gauges. The five-digit mechanical odometer shows 68k miles.",
      "A plaque located ahead of the Hurst shifter indicates that this car was #210 modified by Saleen Autosport for the 1988 model year.",
      "The 5.0-liter High-Output V8 produced 225 horsepower and 300 lb-ft of torque when new.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a five-speed manual transmission and a Traction-Loc limited-slip differential. The selling dealer installed a dual exhaust system with catalytic converters and an H-pipe.",
      "The included correspondence from Saleen identifies this car as one of 15 with these exact colors and options.",
      "The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage."

Equipment includes a blue convertible top, a removable hardtop, power steering, 14″ Bundt alloy wheels, and a heater. The selling dealer acquired the car in 2024 and has since added approximately 100 miles. This W113 SL is now offered at no reserve with British Columbia registration.",

It was optioned with xenon headlights and heated power-adjustable seats, and additional equipment includes a sunroof, a deployable rear spoiler, a Becker-Porsche radio, cruise control, automatic climate control, and 18″ Turbo Look II wheels that have been refinished in chrome.

      "This 2014 Chevrolet Camaro 2SS coupe was purchased new by its current owner, and a Magnuson supercharger kit was subsequently added to its 6.2-liter V8. The drivetrain was further modified with a Livernois camshaft and cylinder heads, a Roto-Fab intake system, a displacement-on-demand eliminator kit, ID850 injectors, and exhaust components from Corsa, Stainless Works, and NOWEEDS as well as a Precision Industries torque converter and an external cooler for the six-speed automatic transmission. Finished in black over matching leather upholstery, the car was optioned with the RS package and is equipped with a limited-slip differential, 20″ alloy wheels, Brembo brakes, BMR trailing arms and toe rods, a rear spoiler, and xenon headlights along with heated power-adjustable front seats, a head-up display, Boston Acoustics audio, air conditioning, and MyLink infotainment. With 13k miles, this fifth-generation Camaro is now offered by the seller on behalf of its owner with a window sticker, owner’s manuals, an accident-free Carfax report, and a clean Michigan title in the owner’s name.",
      "The car is finished in black with a matching vented hood and rear spoiler. Exterior details include xenon headlights with LED halo rings as well as LED running lights, heated power-adjustable side mirrors, LED taillights, and dual exhaust outlets. Scrapes under the front lip are noted by the seller, along with a right-side door ding and chipped paint on the front bumper cover.",
      "Silver-finished 20″ five-spoke alloy wheels are mounted with 245/45 front and 275/40 rear Pirelli P Zero tires that have 2013 production-date codes. Braking is provided by Brembo calipers fitted over ventilated discs, and the suspension has been modified with BMR trailing arms and toe rods.",
      "The heated and power-adjustable front seats are upholstered in black leather with SS headrest embroidery, and the dashboard, door panels, and rear bench are trimmed to match. Additional appointments include MyLink infotainment, a Boston Acoustics sound system, air conditioning, and an auto-dimming rearview mirror.",
      "The leather-wrapped multifunction steering wheel frames a 180-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 6,250-rpm redline as well as auxiliary gauges for fuel level and coolant temperature, all supplemented by a head-up display. Additional gauges for oil pressure, voltage, oil temperature, and transmission temperature are housed in the center console. The digital odometer indicates 13k miles, all of which were added under current ownership. The warning for low tire pressure remains on after startup.",
      "The 6.2-liter V8 has been modified with a Magnuson TVS2300 Heartbeat supercharger kit, a Livernois LS Stage 2 Hi-Lift camshaft, and ported and milled Livernois Stage 2 cylinder heads. The throttle body was ported, and a kit to eliminate the displacement-on-demand system has been added along with a Roto-Fab cold-air intake system, a Livernois dual-fuel-pump kit, and Injector Dynamics ID850 injectors.",
      "Power is routed to the rear wheels via a six-speed automatic transmission and a limited-slip differential. A Precision Industries torque converter with a 3k-rpm stall speed has been fitted along with an external transmission cooler and axles rated for 1,000 horsepower. Aftermarket exhaust components include a Corsa cat-back stainless-steel system, Stainless Works long-tube headers, and a NOWEEDS electronic exhaust diverter system.",
      "The window sticker lists initial delivery to Hank Graff Chevrolet in Davison, Michigan, factory colors and equipment, and a total vehicle price of $41,185.",
      "The Carfax report is free of accident or damage entries and it notes an open manufacturer safety recall from June 2014."

The truck is finished in black over black leather upholstery, and additional equipment includes a three-speed automatic transmission, a dual-range transfer case, a BeCool aluminum radiator, a silver removable hardtop, a domed hood with pins, retractable side steps, trimmed fenders, a microsuede headliner, a wood-rimmed steering wheel, a lockable center console, and aftermarket audio equipment. Acquired by the current owner in 2019, the truck now shows 30k miles. This Bronco is offered by the seller on behalf of the current owner with a clean California title in the name of the owner and their trust.",

The tailgate handle does not work and the windshield wipers need to be replaced. Close-up images of exterior blemishes are provided in the gallery.",

The truck rides on a lifted suspension with Bilstein shocks. Stopping power is provided by front discs and rear drums with a Hydratech Hydroboost system. The seller states the vehicle needs an alignment.",

Appointments include a microsuede headliner, a lockable center console, a heater, and aftermarket audio equipment. The detached rearview mirror is included in the sale. A rip is visible on the side of the driver’s seat.",
      "The wood-rimmed three-spoke steering wheel features a Ford Mustang center logo and fronts a 100-mph speedometer, a column-mounted Sun tachometer, and supplementary gauges. The five-digit odometer shows 30k miles, approximately 7k of which were added under current ownership. The aftermarket oil pressure, voltage, and coolant temperature gauges mounted within the dashboard are said to have been installed under current ownership.",
      "The 302ci V8 is said to have received a top-end overhaul under prior ownership and is equipped with a FiTech EFI system, a BeCool aluminum radiator, Cobra-branded valve covers, a purple-finished aftermarket heat exchanger, and a dual-exhaust system with four-into-one headers. The battery, alternator, and voltage regulator were reportedly replaced in preparation for the sale.",

      "This 1986 Chevrolet C10 Scottsdale pickup is powered by a 5.3-liter Vortec V8 linked with a 4L60E four-speed automatic transmission and the truck is finished in white and blue over blue vinyl upholstery. Equipment includes a Belltech lowered suspension, 20″ American Racing wheels, power steering, power front disc brakes, an aluminum radiator, and Speed Engineering long-tube headers. The cabin is outfitted with a sliding rear window, a push-button AM/FM stereo, and air conditioning. The selling dealer acquired the truck in 2022 and has since added approximately 1,500 miles. This C10 is now offered in Alabama with an owner’s manual and a North Carolina title.",
      "The truck was repainted in white and blue under prior ownership and features a Fleetside bed as well as dual rectangular headlights, dual side mirrors, bright trim, and chrome bumpers. There is a dent in the passenger door.",
      "The 20″ American Racing Torq Thrust Wheels are mounted with Pirelli tires measuring 245/40 up front and 295/40 out back. The truck is equipped with a Belltech lowered suspension and power steering. Power-assisted front discs and rear drums provide braking.",
      "The bench seat is trimmed in blue vinyl upholstery joined by a color-coordinated dashboard, door panels, and carpets. Interior appointments include a sliding rear window, a push-button AM/FM stereo, air conditioning, and Chevrolet-branded rubber floormats.",
      "The four-spoke steering wheel frames an 85-mph speedometer and gauges for voltage, oil pressure, and coolant temperature. The fuel gauge does not work. The five-digit odometer shows 30k miles, although the speedometer and odometer do not work. Total mileage is unknown.",
      "The 5.3-liter Vortec V8 was installed in 2022 and is said to have been sourced from a 2002 Chevrolet Tahoe. An Edelbrock air cleaner, an aluminum radiator, electric cooling fans, and Speed Engineering long-tube exhaust headers have been fitted.",
      "Power is routed to the rear wheels through a 4L60E four-speed automatic transmission and a 10-bolt rear axle. The transmission is said to have been rebuilt under prior ownership. An aftermarket dual exhaust system has been fitted and terminates before the rear axle.",
      "The SPID label shows factory equipment and colors.",
      "The Carfax report shows no accidents or other damage and lists a Not Actual Mileage Title issued in July 2018."

      "The car is finished in Agate Gray Metallic and has bi-xenon headlights with Porsche Dynamic Light System (PDLS) as well as fog lights, a sunroof, front and rear parking sensors, LED taillights, clear side markers, and a speed-activated rear spoiler. The front spoiler and lip were repaired in preparation for the sale.",
      "This is a relist after the vehicle was previously sold on BaT in May 2024 and the sale was not completed due to some complexities surrounding emissions and title information, which have since been resolved. Neither the seller nor winning bidder were at fault.",
      "The 20″ Carrera S alloy wheels are mounted with 245/35 front and 305/30 rear Michelin Pilot Sport 4s tires showing 2022 date codes. Braking is handled by red-painted Porsche-branded calipers over cross-drilled and ventilated discs. The car is equipped with Power Steering Plus and PASM sport suspension.",
      "The heated and ventilated power-adjustable adaptive Sport Plus front seats are upholstered in black leather with Guards Red seatbelts, and the footwells have been fitted with Rennline floor liners. Interior appointments include Porsche Entry & Drive, PCM with navigation, the Light Design Package, and cruise control. The heater wiring harness was replaced in June 2024.",
      "The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a central tachometer with a 7,600-rpm redline as well as a 200-mph speedometer and gauges for oil temperature, oil pressure, coolant temperature, and fuel level. The optional Sport Chrono Package added a stopwatch atop the dashboard. The digital odometer indicates 51k miles, approximately 3k of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The 3.8-liter flat-six was factory rated at 400 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque. The car is equipped with a Fabspeed exhaust system. An oil change was performed in preparation for the sale, and the car passed a California smog test in June 2024.",

      "This 2013 Lamborghini Gallardo LP570-4 Spyder Performante has 10k miles and is powered by a 5.2-liter V10 which drives all four wheels through a six-speed automated transaxle and limited-slip differentials. Finished in Bianco Monocerus over Nero Alcantara upholstery, the car was optioned with xenon headlights with washers, a black soft top, a fixed rear wing, a back-up camera, ceramic-composite brakes, 19″ Scorpius wheels, a front-axle lift system, bucket seats, carbon-fiber interior and exterior accents, and navigation. Purchased by the seller in 2020, this Gallardo Spyder Performante is now offered in Florida with a car cover, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Alaska title in the name of the seller’s LLC.",
      "The carbon-fiber bodywork and aluminum components employed in the construction of the Spyder Performante resulted in weight savings of approximately 143 pounds as compared to the contemporary Gallardo LP560-4 Spyder. This example is finished in Bianco Monocerus with color-contrasting graphics and a carbon-fiber rear diffuser, side skirts, fixed rear wing, and mirror casings. Additional details include a black convertible soft top, xenon headlights with washers, LED taillights, and exhaust outlets that exit through the rear valance. Paint protection film has been applied to the front bumper cover, front fenders, hood, and mirror caps, and the exterior has received a ceramic coating.",
      "The 19″ Scorpius alloy wheels are mounted with 235/35 front and 295/30 rear Pirelli P Zero tires. The car is equipped with an optional front-axle lift system, and stopping power is provided by cross-drilled and ventilated ceramic-composite discs with black-finished calipers at each corner. The brake fluid was flushed in December 2020, and replacement TPMS sensors were fitted in January 2022.",
      "The cabin is upholstered in Nero Alcantara that extends from the manually adjustable dual bucket seats to the dashboard and rear bulkhead. Carbon-fiber trim accents the cabin, and additional appointments include a back-up camera, navigation, Performante-branded sill plates, cruise control, Lamborghini logos on the headrests, and dual-zone automatic climate control. A ceramic coating has been applied to various interior components, per the seller.",
      "The Alcantara- and carbon-fiber-trimmed steering wheel fronts a pair of paddle shifters as well as a 210-mph speedometer and a tachometer with an 8,500-rpm redline, and gauges for coolant temperature and fuel level. Gauges for oil temperature, oil pressure, and battery voltage are located on the dashboard. The digital odometer indicates 10k miles, approximately 800 of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The 5.2-liter V10 was factory rated at 562 horsepower and 398 lb-ft of torque. Work in December 2020 included flushing the coolant, replacing the front and rear differential fluids, and installing a replacement drive belt, air filters, and spark plugs. A replacement battery was installed in November 2023, and an oil change was performed in January 2024.",
      "Power is delivered to all four wheels through a six-speed E-gear automated transaxle, limited-slip front and rear differentials, and a Viscous Traction permanent all-wheel drive system. The seller states the clutch was examined in May 2024 and showed approximately 32% of wear.",
      "The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage."

The selling dealer purchased the car in 2024. This fourth-generation Camaro SS is now offered in South Carolina at no reserve with the owner’s manual, spare parts, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Montana title.",
      "The car is finished in Light Pewter Metallic and is equipped with a black convertible soft top, SS badges, fog lights, a rear spoiler, and dual exhaust outlets. A blemish on the front end is noted by the selling dealer.",
      "The 17″ split-spoke alloy wheels are mounted with Hankook Ventus V4 ES tires. Additional SS equipment included a performance suspension with a larger front stabilizer bar, revised shock valving, and stiffer springs and bushings than the standard Camaro, and the car is equipped with Acceleration Slip Regulation. Stopping power is provided by four-wheel anti-lock ventilated disc brakes.",
      "The seats are upholstered in Ebony leather and interior features include a power-adjustable driver’s seat, a CD stereo, a Monsoon sound system, cruise control, Camaro SS-branded floormats, and air conditioning. Wear is visible on the driver’s seat bolster.",
      "The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a 155-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 6k-rpm redline as well as gauges for coolant temperature, oil pressure, voltage, and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 45k miles.",
      "The 5.7-liter LS1 V8 was factory rated at 325 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque.",
      "Power is routed to the rear wheels via a four-speed automatic transmission and a Torsen limited-slip differential.",
      "The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage."

      "The 3.9-liter F inline-six features a single carburetor.",

      "This 1966 Sunbeam is said to have been purchased by the prior owner in 1990 as a non-running project before being acquired from their estate by the seller in 2023. Based upon the features, components, and serial numbers and plates, the seller believes the car to be a Mk 1A Tiger. The car is finished in red and features a removable black hardtop, a banjo-style steering wheel, seats trimmed in black vinyl, aftermarket shocks, and 13″ steel wheels. It has been partially stripped and the engine and four-speed manual gearbox have been removed, though the latter is included in the sale along with a collection of additional spare and removed parts. This Sunbeam project is now offered at no reserve with transferable New York State registration in the seller’s name.",
      "Previously finished in black, the car underwent bodywork and was repainted in its current shade of red in the early 2000s under previous ownership. It is accompanied by a removable black hardtop. The convertible top has been removed along with the headlights, bumpers, and various exterior trim pieces.",
      "The car wears a mismatched set of 13″ steel wheels mounted with older tires. Aftermarket shocks have been added, and the front disc and rear drum brakes are retained.",
      "The interior has been partially stripped and houses bucket seats trimmed in black vinyl. Rust is visible on various metal surfaces.",
      "The banjo-style steering wheel sits ahead of a burl wood veneer dashboard. The factory Jaeger instrumentation has been taken out and will accompany the car.",
      "The engine and transmission have been removed, and the latter is included in the sale.",
      "Rust is visible on the underbody, and additional underside photos are presented in the gallery.",
      "The chassis plate is shown above and the car’s serial number aligns with Mk 1A production. Additional identifying markings are presented in the gallery.",
      "A collection of spare and removed parts will accompany the car."

      "This 1998 Rover Mini Cooper BSCC Limited is finished in black with a white roof and powered by a fuel-injected 1.3-liter inline-four linked to a four-speed manual transaxle. The car wears Sport Pack–style 13″ alloy wheels and wheel arch extensions along with dual driving lights and a center-exit HKS muffler. Inside, the seats are trimmed in green leather and accompanied by wood veneer trim along with an airbag steering wheel, air conditioning, and a Clarion stereo. The car underwent a repaint in Japan before being brought to Canada and was acquired by the current owner in 2019. This Mk VII Cooper is now offered at no reserve on dealer consignment in Ontario, Canada, with a clean Carfax report and Ontario registration.",
      "A Japanese-market version of the Sport LE model offered in the UK, the BSCC Limited was built to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the Mini Cooper’s race victories in the 1968 British Saloon Car Championship. This example was disassembled and repainted black with a white roof prior to importation from Japan. The car wears white mirror caps and hood stripes along with replacement decals, and further details include dual driving lights, Sport Pack–style wheel arch extensions, side window deflectors, a leather fuel filler bib, and a center-exit HKS muffler.",
      "Sport Pack–style 13″ alloy wheels are mounted with 175/60 Yokohama AS39 tires. Braking is handled by front discs and rear drums.",
      "The front bucket seats and rear bench are trimmed in green leather, and color-coordinated upholstery extends to the door and side panels. Wood veneer trim accents the cabin, and further details include air conditioning, a gearshift lever extension, and three-point seatbelts. A Bluetooth-capable Clarion stereo has been added, though the seller notes that it does not pick up North American stations.",
      "The airbag steering wheel wears a Mini Cooper badge and is wrapped in green and perforated black leather. Instrumentation consists of a 180-km/h speedometer, a tachometer, and a combination gauge. The five-digit odometer shows 26k kilometers (~15k miles) and has rolled over. Approximately 7k kilometers (~4k miles) have been added under current ownership.",
      "The 1.3L A-series inline-four features single-point injection (SPi) and was factory-rated at 62 horsepower and 70 lb-ft of torque. A replacement battery and engine mount were installed in preparation for the sale.",
      "Power is sent to the front wheels through a four-speed manual transaxle, which is said to have been rebuilt in 2019.",
      "Decoding the VIN tag provides the following information:",
      "The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage.",
      "The vehicle is being sold on its Ontario registration, which serves as the ownership document in Ontario, Canada. The sale does not include a title."

      "This 1966 Shelby Mustang GT350 was invoiced to Marv Tonkin Ford in Portland, Oregon, on February 25, 1966, finished in Candy Apple Red with cast alloy wheels and a Sport Deck rear seat. The car remained with four owners in Oregon before being purchased by the current owner in Washington in 2005. An ensuing refurbishment was completed in 2006 and saw the car repainted in its factory color with white stripes, and it is powered by a 289ci HiPo V8 linked with a T-10 four-speed manual transmission. Other equipment includes black vinyl upholstery, front disc brakes, Koni shocks, dual exhaust, Flowmaster mufflers, a Holley 715-cfm carburetor, PerTronix ignition, a steel-reinforced fiberglass hood, a wood-rimmed steering wheel, and an AM radio. This GT350 is now offered in Portland, Oregon, on dealer consignment with a copy of the original invoice, service records, and a clean Washington title.",
      "The car was delivered new in Candy Apple Red (J) and was repainted in 2006. White over-the-top and rocker stripes have been added, while the car is also equipped with a steel-reinforced fiberglass hood with variable-diameter hood springs and hood pins as well as a driver-side mirror, functional side scoops, double-curved plexiglass quarter panels, and re-chromed bumpers and bumperettes.",
      "Sand-cast 10-spoke alloy wheels are mounted with 225/60 front and 245/60 rear BFGoodrich Radial T/A tires that are said to have been recently installed. GT350s were factory-equipped with Kelsey-Hayes front disc brakes as well as larger rear drums than standard Mustangs. Suspension components include Shelby lowered front A-arms, overrider traction bars, axle-limiting cables, and Koni shocks. The car is equipped with a quick-ratio steering box.",
      "The cabin features low-back bucket seats and a Sport Deck rear seat trimmed in black vinyl. Lap belts are in place for four occupants, while an AM radio is situated in the dash. The glovebox door contains a Carroll Shelby signature.",
      "The wood-rimmed steering wheel frames a 140-mph speedometer flanked by fuel-level, oil-pressure, amperage, and coolant-temperature gauges, and a Cobra-branded 9k-rpm tachometer is center-mounted atop the dash. The five-digit odometer shows 33k miles.",
      "The 289ci HiPo V8 was reportedly rebuilt by Gray’s Automotive Machine Shop in McMinnville, Oregon, during the refurbishment and is topped by a Holley 715-cfm central-pivot four-barrel carburetor that is said to have been rebuilt in preparation for the sale. Equipment includes a 7.5-quart aluminum oil pan, Cobra “open-letter” valve covers, a dual-point distributor with PerTronix ignition, and a cast-aluminum high-rise intake manifold. The fuel-sending unit was replaced in October 2023, and the alternator and voltage regulator were reportedly recently replaced.",
      "Dynamometer test results from 2007 show peak outputs of 257 rear-wheel horsepower and 284 lb-ft of torque.",
      "Power is routed to the rear wheels through an aluminum-case T-10 four-speed manual transmission that is said to have been recently rebuilt. The rear axle seals were replaced in July 2021. The dual exhaust system features ceramic-coated tri-Y headers, a crossover pipe, and Flowmaster mufflers. The rear end is equipped with 3.89:1 gearing."

Braid 17″ wheels were also installed along with Elephant Racing coilover suspension and upgraded brakes, while the interior was overhauled with Recaro seats, Rennline pedals, and a MOMO Prototipo steering wheel. The current owner purchased the car in 2018 and has since added approximately 2k of the 128k miles now shown. This Carrera coupe is now offered on dealer consignment with build records and a clean Illinois title.",
      "The car was modified with a 1972-style front bumper, a 1973-style rear bumper, 930-specification flares, a 964-specification engine cover and spoiler, and a long hood before it was repainted Stone Grey. Paint protection film was applied along with a ceramic coating in 2020.",
      "H4 headlights modified with projector beams were installed along with early-style grilles and lenses, and the weather seals were replaced along with the emblems.",
      "Braid Fuchs-style wheels measure 17×9″ up front and 17×11″ out back, and they wear Nitto tires measuring 255/40 and 315/35, respectively. Elephant Racing coilover suspension has been installed along with upgraded braking components.",
      "An RS-style carpet set, RS American door panels, and a roll bar were installed inside, and the rear seats were removed. The Recaro seats are trimmed in black leather with plaid accents, and matching upholstery covers the lower dashboard.",
      "A MOMO Prototipo steering wheel was installed along with Rennline pedals. The instrument cluster was rebuilt in June 2020 by Nichols Speedometer and now shows 128k miles, approximately 2k of which were added by the owner.",
      "The flat-six was rebuilt to displace 3.4 liters with Mahle pistons, Carillo connecting rods, ARP hardware, Web Cams 296° camshafts, rebuilt rockers, upgraded valve springs, titanium retainers, twin-spark heads, a Rasant Products GT3-style plenum with individual throttle bodies, and Megasquirt engine management.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a G50 five-speed manual transaxle. And M&K stainless-steel exhaust system was installed during the build.",
      "Records from the build are included in the sale and displayed in the gallery below.",
      "The Carfax report is free of reported damage or accidents."

    "description": [
      "This 1987 Mercedes-Benz 190E 2.3-16 is a Canadian-market example that remained with its original owner in Ontario before the seller acquired it in 2023. Power is provided by a 2.3-liter inline-four mated to a dogleg five-speed manual transmission, and the car is finished in Smoke Silver Metallic over black leather upholstery. Equipment includes a limited-slip differential, a self-leveling suspension, 15″ Gullideckel alloy wheels, a power sunroof, and a trunk lid spoiler with an integrated brake light as well as power-adjustable bolstered front seats, automatic climate control, cruise control, and power windows. Work in February 2024 involved replacing the valve cover gasket, alternator, radiator, and tires. This W201 is now offered in Canada with manufacturer’s literature, a tool kit, spare parts, a Carfax report, and Ontario registration in the seller’s name.",
      "The car is finished in Smoke Silver Metallic (702) and features a body-color front air dam, side skirts, wheel-arch flares, and trunk spoiler with an integrated third brake light. Additional exterior details include a hood ornament, integrated fog lights, headlight wipers, a power sunroof, and asymmetrical side mirrors. The grommet for the power antenna was replaced in February 2024. The Carfax report contains an August 2003 entry describing a damage claim. The seller states this was a curb collision incident that resulted in damage to the left side skirt, which was subsequently repaired along with the exhaust system. Photos provided in the gallery show scrapes on the front-right area of the car and corrosion is noted on the left edge of the trunk lid.",
      "The 15″ Gullideckel alloy wheels were mounted with 205/55 Yokohama Advan Fleva tires in February 2024. The brake fluid was flushed and the power steering filter was replaced at that time. An adjustable self-leveling suspension was equipped from the factory, and braking is handled by four-wheel ventilated discs with ABS. A power steering fluid leak is noted by the seller.",
      "The power-adjustable bolstered front sport seats are upholstered in black leather that extends to the rear bench and portions of the door panels. Wood trim accents the center stack, and amenities include driver seat-position memory, cruise control, and power-operated windows. The Becker Grand Prix cassette stereo is in anti-theft mode and the fan speed selector switch is stuck in the second-lowest position.",
      "The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a tachometer with a 6,500-rpm redline and an inset analog clock as well as a 240-km/h speedometer and gauges for fuel level, coolant temperature, oil pressure, and instant fuel economy. Gauges for voltage and oil temperature reside in the center stack. The six-digit mechanical odometer shows 133k kilometers (~83k miles), less than 1k kilometers were added by the seller. The Carfax report contains a January 2012 entry describing a potential odometer rollback and notes a mileage inconsistency in the most recent entry from February 2024. True mileage is unknown.",
      "The 2.3-liter M102 inline-four was designed in collaboration with Cosworth and was factory rated at 167 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque. The fluids and filters were changed in February 2024, and further work at that time included replacing the valve cover gasket, alternator, battery, spark plugs, coolant temperature sensor, and radiator. The fuel pump relay, over-voltage relay, and climate control relay are said to have been replaced in preparation for the sale.",
      "Power is delivered to the rear wheels through a Getrag five-speed manual gearbox and a limited-slip differential, both of which received fluid changes in February 2024.",
      "The Carfax report contains the aforementioned 2003 damage report as well as the aforementioned entries from 2012 and 2024 describing mileage inconsistencies. There is a gap in entries between August 1987 and February 1999.",
      "The vehicle is being sold on its Ontario registration, which serves as the ownership document in Ontario, Canada. The sale does not include a title.",

      "This 2004 Chevrolet SSR was purchased new by the current owner and now has 3,300 miles following history in New Jersey. It is finished in Smokin’ Asphalt over Ebony leather and is powered by a 5.3-liter V8 linked to a four-speed automatic transmission and a limited-slip differential. Equipment includes the 1SB Preferred Equipment Group, a power-folding hardtop, satin chrome running boards, wood cargo floor rub strips, integrated side-saddle cargo area storage, a sport suspension, heated power-adjustable twin bucket seats, remote keyless entry, cruise control, and air conditioning. This SSR is now offered on dealer consignment with a window sticker, the owner’s manual, a recent service record, a clean Carfax report, and a clean New Jersey title.",
      "The SSR was built on a modified version of the GMT360 platform shared with the contemporary TrailBlazer SUV, and its styling was inspired by the Chevrolet Advance Design family of trucks. This example is finished in Smokin’ Asphalt with a color-matched hardshell tonneau cover and a power-retractable convertible hardtop. Additional equipment includes flush-mounted halogen headlights bisected by a satin-finished chevron bar as well as flush-mounted taillights, power-operated heated side mirrors, integrated satin chrome running boards, and dual polished exhaust tips. The carpeted cargo bed is accented with wood strips and features integrated side-saddle cargo area storage. Photos of paint meter readings are provided in the gallery below.",
      "Silver-finished 19″ front and 20″ rear five-spoke cast-aluminum wheels are mounted with 255/45 front and 295/40 rear Goodyear Eagle RS-A tires. The SSR was equipped from the factory with a ZQ8 sport suspension featuring an independent front and five-link solid-axle rear setup with front and rear stabilizer bars. Stopping power is provided by four-wheel ventilated disc brakes.",
      "The twin heated and power-adjustable high-back bucket seats are upholstered in Ebony leather complemented by satin chrome trim. Amenities include a color-keyed waterfall console as well as a CD stereo, air conditioning, and cruise control.",
      "The leather-wrapped multifunction steering wheel frames SSR-branded instrumentation including a 140-mph speedometer, a 7k-rpm tachometer, and gauges for fuel level, coolant temperature, and oil pressure. Auxiliary gauges for voltage, fuel consumption, and transmission temperature are mounted below the center console and feature satin silver-finished bezels. The digital odometer indicates 3,300 miles.",
      "The 5.3-liter Vortec 5300 V8 wears an SSR-branded engine cover and was factory rated at 300 horsepower and 335 lb-ft of torque. The oil was changed and the battery was replaced in March 2024.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a four-speed automatic transmission and a Torsen limited-slip differential.",
      "The window sticker notes initial delivery to Bergey’s Chevrolet in Colmar, Pennsylvania, and lists factory equipment, colors, options, and a total vehicle price of $46,150. Manufacturer’s literature and a recent service record are also included in the sale.",
      "The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage."

      "This 1969 BMW R69US was purchased new by the seller’s father, who took delivery of the bike in Germany and toured Europe on it for three weeks before shipping it to the US. The bike was reportedly stored from 1992 until 2018, at which time ownership transferred to the seller. Finished in Avus Black, the motorcycle is powered by a 594cc opposed twin paired with a four-speed gearbox. Equipment includes 18″ alloy rims, drum brakes, a conventional telescopic fork, preload-adjustable shocks, dual Bing carburetors, and a driveshaft along with a Schorsch Meier two-up seat, a chrome cross-braced handlebar, bar-end turn signals, and both center and side stands. This R69US is now offered with a pair of panniers, a shop manual, parts receipts, and a clean Wyoming title in the seller’s name.",
      "The bike is finished in Avus Black with double white pinstripes on the fenders and the fuel tank, which is equipped with black rubber knee grips, enameled roundels, and a topside storage compartment. Features include a Denfeld Schorsch Meier two-up seat upholstered in white-piped black vinyl in addition to bar-end turn signals, a left-side bar-mounted mirror, a frame-mounted air pump, and both center and side stands. Rust on the left side of the rear fender is noted by the seller.",
      "Wire-spoke 18″ wheels with shouldered alloy rims and drum-brake hubs wear older Metzler tires, and the rear inner tube was replaced in 2024. Suspension is provided by a conventional telescopic fork as well as preload-adjustable shocks mounted to the swingarm on the left and the final-drive housing on the right.",
      "Instrumentation ahead of the chrome cross-braced handlebar consists of a VDO 120-mph speedometer and a pair of indicator lights. The five-digit odometer shows 3k miles, approximately 250 of which were ridden under current ownership. The horn button’s movement is restricted, the left turn signal works intermittently, and the lights do not work properly until the bike has been running for a while.",
      "The 594cc opposed twin features dual Bing carburetors and was factory rated at 42 horsepower. The carburetors were overhauled in 2019, and the throttle cable and fuel line were replaced at that time. The carburetor seals are said to drip temporarily following longer periods of non-use. Scrapes on the right-side valve cover are depicted in the gallery.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheel through a four-speed transmission as well as a driveshaft enclosed within the right leg of the swingarm.",
      "The headstock plate indicates that this bike is an R69US with serial number 665622, and the matching numbers stamped on the frame and the engine case can be viewed in the gallery.",
      "A pair of removable leather panniers is included in the sale."

      "This 1968 Mazda Cosmo is a Japanese-market example, and one of 833 Series II examples produced between July 1968 and September 1972. It remained in Japan until 2006, and it was purchased by the current owner in 2013 and subsequently featured in a collection. The car is finished in white over black vinyl upholstery with houndstooth cloth seat inserts, and power comes from a 982cc 10A twin-rotor engine paired with a five-speed manual transmission. Features include a Hitachi four-barrel carburetor, power-assisted front disc brakes, 15″ steel wheels, fender-mounted mirrors, air conditioning, a Clarion push-button AM radio, and a wood-rimmed steering wheel. This L10B Cosmo is now offered by the seller on behalf of the current owner with a Texas title in the owner’s name.",
      "The Cosmo was developed as a halo vehicle for Mazda and was introduced at the Tokyo Motor Show ahead of the 1964 Tokyo Summer Olympics. It entered production in May 1967, with all units being built by hand at Mazda’s Hiroshima factory. The Series II Cosmo debuted in 1968, and featured a wheelbase increased by 15cm as well as 15″ wheels, a revised front end, a more powerful engine, and a five-speed manual transmission. This example is finished in white and features chrome bumpers and trim, covered headlights, fender-mounted mirrors, and a dual-exit exhaust that exits through the rear valance.",
      "Painted steel 15″ wheels wear chrome center caps with blue Mazda rotary badges, and they are mounted with 165/80 Bridgestone Sneaker tires. A spare wheel is stowed beneath the trunk floor. The front suspension features a conventional control-arm configuration with coil springs and an anti-roll bar, while a leaf-sprung de Dion axle is equipped out back. Braking is handled by power-assisted front discs and rear drums.",
      "The right-hand-drive cabin features bucket seats trimmed in black vinyl with houndstooth cloth inserts. Red carpets line the floors, and amenities include air conditioning, a Clarion push-button AM radio, a wooden gearshift knob, three-point seat belts, and storage pockets on the seatbacks.",
      "The wood-rimmed steering wheel is mounted on an adjustable column ahead of a 250-km/h speedometer, a tachometer with a 7k-rpm redline, and auxiliary gauges. The five-digit odometer shows 20k kilometers (~13k miles), approximately 200 of which were added under current ownership. Total mileage is unknown.",
      "The 982cc 10A twin-rotor engine was revised for the Series II Cosmo and features two spark plugs per chamber as well as dual distributors and a single Hitachi four-barrel carburetor. Output was factory rated at 128 horsepower, an 18-horsepower increase over Series I cars.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels via a five-speed manual transmission."

      "This 1975 Honda CB360T is said to have spent time as part of indoor collections in both Pennsylvania and North Carolina before it was acquired by the seller in 2020, and it now shows 9k miles. Finished in Light Ruby Red with black and white stripes, the bike is powered by a 356cc SOHC parallel twin paired with a six-speed transmission. It is also equipped with a kick starter, an electric starter, a chrome-finished two-into-two exhaust system, a front disc brake, 18″ wire-spoke wheels, chrome fenders, a two-up seat, and both center and side stands. The dual Keihin carburetors were reportedly rebuilt in 2015, while work in 2023 is said to have included servicing the oiling and ignition systems. This CB360T is offered at no reserve with an owner’s manual, a tool kit, and a clean Virginia title in the seller’s name.",
      "The bike is finished in Light Ruby Red, and black and white stripes accent the 2.9-gallon fuel tank. Additional details include dual mirrors, chrome-finished fenders, a black vinyl-upholstered two-up seat with a passenger grab strap, and both center and side stands.",
      "Wire-spoke 18″ wheels are mounted with IRC Grand High Speed tires. Suspension consists of a telescopic fork in addition to dual shocks connected to the swingarm. Braking is handled by a front disc and a rear drum.",
      "The chrome handlebar is mounted aft of Nippon Seiki instrumentation consisting of a 110-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 9,200-rpm redline, while a bank of indicator lights is located between the gauges. The five-digit odometer shows 9k miles.",
      "The 356cc SOHC parallel twin features a kick starter, an electric starter, replacement air cleaners, and a chrome-finished two-into-two exhaust system. Factory-rated output was 34 horsepower. The seller states that the dual Keihin carburetors were rebuilt in 2015 and that replacement engine case cover fasteners were sourced from David Silver Spares. Work in 2023 is said to have included changing the battery and fluids, cleaning the oiling system and fitting replacement gaskets and O-rings, adjusting the ignition timing and timing chain tension, and changing the battery, ignition points, spark plugs, and fluids.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheel through a six-speed transmission and a drive chain.",
      "An owner’s manual and a tool kit will accompany the motorcycle."

      "This 1974 Ford Bronco Explorer has been cosmetically and mechanically refurbished, which included repainting the exterior Brook Blue and refreshing the interior with blue vinyl and houndstooth cloth upholstery, replacement carpets and door panels, a RetroSound stereo, and an aftermarket air conditioning system. The 302ci V8 was fitted with an Edelbrock carburetor and intake manifold, and the three-speed automatic transmission was overhauled. Additional work included replacing braking, suspension, and exhaust components as well as the valve lifters, pushrods, timing chain, oil pump, fuel sending unit, fuel pump, water pump, and starter. Acquired by the selling dealer in 2022, the truck now shows 58k miles, and it is offered in New York with a Deluxe Marti report and a clean California title.",
      "During the refurbishment, the body was removed from the frame, the trim, window felts, window seals, and exterior lights were replaced, and the truck was repainted Brook Blue. Equipment includes a white removable hardtop, a rear-mounted spare tire, and chrome bumpers.",
      "The 15″ wheels were powder-coated and mounted with 33×10.5″ BFGoodrich tires during the build, which also reportedly included replacing the brake drums and shoes as well as the shocks, springs, and steering stabilizer.",
      "The front bucket seats were reupholstered in blue vinyl with houndstooth inserts during the refurbishment, which also included replacing the carpets, door panels, and headliner. Amenities include a RetroSound stereo, an aftermarket air conditioning system, and an Explorer badge on the glove box.",

      "Power is routed to the rear or all four wheels via a three-speed automatic transmission and a dual-range transfer case. The selling dealer states the transmission was overhauled and the frame was sand-blasted and repainted during the refurbishment.",
      "The Deluxe Marti report lists factory equipment and production information as well as a build date of March 6, 1974.",
      "Photos taken during the refurbishment are provided in the gallery."

      "This 1976 Chevrolet K10 4×4 pickup was acquired by its late owner in 1986 and subsequently modified to resemble a GMC and fitted with a 502ci V8 that is backed by a four-speed automatic transmission and a dual-range transfer case. The truck is finished in black over red cloth and vinyl, and features include a receiver hitch, a sliding rear window, manually locking front hubs, power steering, 15″ wheels, and 33″ tires. This K1500 is now offered at no reserve by the seller on behalf of an estate with a clean Maryland title in the name of the late owner.",
      "The truck was refinished in black in the 1990s and is equipped with a receiver hitch, a sliding rear window, chrome bumpers, and GMC badging.",
      "The 15″ wheels are mounted with 33×12.5″ BFGoodrich Radial All-Terrain T/A tires. The truck is equipped with power steering and manually locking front hubs. Braking is provided by front discs and rear drums.",
      "The cabin houses a bench seat upholstered in red cloth and vinyl. Woodgrain trim accents the dashboard. The headliner is loose. The radio and components for the air conditioning have been removed.",
      "The two-spoke GMC-branded steering wheel frames a 100-mph speedometer, a tachometer, and auxiliary gauges. The five-digit odometer shows 11k miles, and total mileage is unknown.",
      "The seller notes that the 502ci V8 was installed in the 1990s. It is equipped with an Edelbrock intake manifold and tube-style headers feeding a dual exhaust system.",
      "Power is routed to all four wheels through a four-speed automatic transmission and a dual-range transfer case. A 12-bolt rear end with a welded-on brace is fitted.",
      "The truck is being offered on behalf of an estate."

      "This 1966 Ford Mustang coupe was refurbished under previous ownership and is finished in Emberglo over Emberglo and Parchment vinyl. The car is powered by an A-code 289ci V8 paired with a three-speed automatic transmission, and features include a Pony-style interior, 14″ styled steel wheels, front disc brakes, a vinyl roof, chrome bumpers, GT badging, fog lights, front bucket seats, a Custom AutoSound stereo, Magnaflow mufflers, and a cabin heater. The selling dealer acquired the car in 2023, and subsequent work included balancing the driveshaft, replacing the U-joints, and changing fluids. This Mustang is now offered at no reserve with the owner’s manual and a clean Washington title.",
      "The car was factory-finished in Emberglo and refinished under previous ownership. Additional work included rechroming the bumpers and adding a white vinyl roof. Features include lower-body stripes, a vinyl roof, fog lights, GT badging, chrome bumpers, and dual exhaust outlets that exit through the rear fascia. Close-up photos of the exterior are shown in the gallery.",
      "The 14″ styled steel wheels are mounted with 215/70 Goodyear Regatta 2 tires. The car is equipped with power steering and KYB shocks and braking is handled by power-assisted front discs and rear drums.",
      "The cabin features front bucket seats and a rear bench reupholstered in Emberglo and Parchment vinyl along with pony backrest embossing. The door panels and carpeting were also replaced. Woodgrain trim accents the dashboard and center console, and amenities include a cabin heater, lap belts, and a Custom AutoSound stereo. Wear is noted on the seat belts and center console.",
      "Instrumentation consists of a 140-mph speedometer, a column-mounted tachometer and clock, and gauges for fuel level, oil pressure, amperage, and coolant temperature. The five-digit odometer shows 43k miles, approximately 300 of which were added under current ownership. Total mileage is unknown.",
      "The 289ci V8 was factory rated at 225 horsepower. The oil was changed in preparation for the sale.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a C4 three-speed automatic transmission. The driveshaft was balanced and the U-joints were replaced under current ownership, and the transmission and rear differential fluids were changed. A dual exhaust system with Magnaflow mufflers is fitted, and the underside is coated.",
      "The warranty number is consistent with a 1966 Mustang coupe that was built in San Jose, California and equipped with a 289ci V8. Decoding the trim tag reveals the following information:"

This example is finished in Mantis Green with a carbon-fiber front splitter, rocker accents, side intakes, and rear bumper insert. Additional exterior details include LED lighting, a power-retractable hardtop, dihedral doors, front and rear parking sensors, and an active rear wing that doubles as an air brake. Blemishes in the front splitter are shown up close in photos below.",

      "This 1995 Porsche 911 Carrera 4 cabriolet remained under the care of its previous owner for approximately twenty-three years, and it now shows 35k miles. The car is powered by a 3.6-liter flat-six that drives all four wheels through a six-speed manual transaxle with a limited-slip differential, and it is finished in Black over black leather. Features include a replacement black soft top, 17″ Cup II wheels, xenon headlights, power-adjustable front seats, supple seat inserts, a remote six-disc CD changer, a Hi-Fi sound system, cruise control, and air conditioning. This 993 C4 cabriolet is offered by the selling dealer with a window sticker, the owner’s manual, service records, an air compressor, a clean Carfax report, and a clean New York title.",
      "The car is finished in Black (L741) and features a replacement power-retractable black soft top as well as xenon headlights with washers, fog lights, heated power-adjustable mirrors, black rear bumperettes, a speed-activated rear spoiler, a “basket handle” fixed rear spoiler with an integrated third brake light, and dual polished exhaust outlets. Paint imperfections are shown in detail in the gallery.",
      "Silver-finished 17″ Cup II wheels are mounted with Michelin Pilot Sport tires. The car features an Automatic Brake Differential (ABD), and the 993 was the first 911 to feature multi-link rear suspension. Braking is handled by silver-finished Porsche-branded calipers over cross-drilled rotors at all four corners.",
      "The cabin features seating surfaces trimmed in black leather with supple inserts, and additional amenities include eight-way power-adjustable front seats, a Hi-Fi sound system, a Becker Porsche CR-1 cassette stereo, a remote six-disc CD changer, cruise control, and air conditioning. Damage to the center console trim is shown up close in the gallery.",
      "The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames VDO instrumentation including a central tachometer with a 6,800-rpm redline, a 180-mph speedometer, a Quarz analog clock, and gauges for oil pressure, oil temperature, oil level, and fuel level. The six-digit odometer shows 35k miles.",
      "The air-cooled 3.6L flat-six was factory rated at 270 horsepower and 243 lb-ft of torque.",
      "Power is sent to all four wheels via a six-speed manual transaxle with a limited-slip differential.",
      "Decoding the option sticker reveals the following information:",
      "The window sticker lists initial delivery to Cherry Hill Imports in New Jersey, along with standard equipment, options, and a total price of $81,251.",
      "The Carfax report is free of accidents or other damage."

      "This 1983 Toyota Land Cruiser FJ45 pickup was acquired out of Venezuela by the current owner in 2023 before it was relocated to Colombia and later imported to the US in December 2023. Power is provided by a 4.2-liter 2F inline-six linked with a four-speed manual transmission and a dual-range transfer case. Work since 2023 has involved refinishing the truck in blue and replacing the bed, fuel tank, 15″ wheels, and tires. It is also equipped with power steering, four-wheel disc brakes, a front winch, air conditioning, and a CD stereo. This FJ45 pickup was listed on BaT in March 2023 and is now offered again by the seller on behalf of the owner with a clean Florida title in the name of the owner’s business.",
      "The seller reports that the truck was refinished in its current shade of blue in 2023 and that the bed was replaced at that time. A Rough Country front winch is fitted along with a drop-down tailgate and a revised front bumper.",
      "Steel 15″ wheels wear hubcaps and are mounted with 31×10.5″ Teraclaw tires. The truck is equipped with power steering and four-wheel disc brakes.",
      "The cab houses split front seats trimmed in gray upholstery. Equipment includes air conditioning, a dash pad, and a CD stereo.",
      "The three-spoke steering wheel frames a 160-km/h speedometer as well as gauges for oil pressure, coolant temperature, amperage, and fuel level. The six-digit odometer shows 105k kilometers (~65k miles), approximately 200 of which were added under current ownership. Total mileage is unknown.",
      "The 4.2-liter 2F inline-six was factory rated at 125 horsepower and is equipped with an aluminum radiator. The engine is said to have been refreshed in 2020 under prior ownership, and the fuel tank was replaced following the seller’s acquisition.",
      "Power is routed to the rear or all four wheels through a four-speed manual transmission and a dual-range transfer case.",
      "Photos of the refurbishment in progress are shown in the gallery below."

    "description": [
      "This 2000 Ducati Monster 750 Dark was purchased by the seller on BaT in February 2023 and now shows 689 miles. The bike is finished in black over a black trellis frame and is powered by an air-cooled 748cc L-twin mated to a five-speed transmission. Equipment includes a desmodromic valvetrain, a two-into-two exhaust system, and Brembo wheels and brake calipers as well as an inverted Showa fork, a Sachs-Boge monoshock, an electric starter, a stepped two-up seat, and a side stand. Service since 2023 is said to have included replacing the tires, battery, clutch discs, brake pads, chain, and sprockets in addition to revalving the rear shock, rebuilding the suspension, and installing LED lighting, Motogadget mo.View mirrors, and transparent belt covers. This Monster Dark is now offered at no reserve with a tool kit, removed parts, and a clean Pennsylvania title in the seller’s name.",
      "The bike is finished in satin black over a gloss black steel trellis frame. Features include a 4.4-gallon fuel tank, Motogadget mo.Blaze LED turn signals, a Revival Secret LED headlight, Motogadget mo.View Classic mirrors, and a stepped two-up sport seat complemented by dual grab rails and folding passenger foot pegs. The side stand has been repainted, and there a touched-up scratch on the left front section of the fuel tank. Other scratches are noted.",
      "Black-finished 17″ Brembo three-spoke wheels were mounted with Michelin Road 6 tires under current ownership. Suspension is handled by an inverted 43mm Showa front fork as well as a box-section swingarm connected to a a revalved adjustable Sachs-Boge monoshock via a progressive linkage. The suspension has reportedly been rebuilt and sprung for a 220-lb rider. Braking is from gold-finished Brembo calipers mounted over drilled rotors at both ends. The seller states that the brake pads and fluid were changed since their purchase.",
      "The chrome low-rise handlebar bearing dual mirrors fronts instrumentation consisting of a 140-mph speedometer, a bank of warning lamps, and a five-digit odometer showing 689 miles. Discoloration is visible on the upper handlebar clamp. The seller has removed the turn signal indicator bulb from the gauge cluster, and, when using the left turn signal, the four-way flashers illuminate.",
      "The two-valve 748cc L-twin is equipped with a desmodromic valvetrain, an electric starter, and a pair of low-mounted upswept mufflers bearing Ducati ZDM-A13/-B13 stamps. The dual Mikuni carburetors were reportedly cleaned and performance jetted in 2017. Equipment is said to include an Antigravity lithium battery, an Oberon clutch slave cylinder, a fuel filter with quick-release fittings, and a manual-valve fuel petcock. Work since 2023 reportedly includes replacing the belts, pulleys, spark plugs, oil and filter, clutch discs, clutch master cylinder, both sprockets, and the air filter. The belt covers have been replaced with transparent units, and stainless-steel engine fasteners have been installed. The charcoal canister has been removed.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheel through a multi-plate wet clutch, a five-speed transmission, and a replacement drive chain.",
      "The motorcycle will be accompanied by a tool kit, removed parts, and a service manual."

Features include HID headlights, carbon-fiber 20″ seven-spoke wheels, Brembo brakes, Recaro front seats, a Bang & Olufsen 12-speaker audio system, and SYNC 3 infotainment with navigation.  Acquired by the selling dealer in 2024, this GT500 Heritage Edition has 8 miles and is now offered in Missouri with a window sticker, the owner’s manual, a car cover, and a clean Massachusetts title.",
      "All GT500 Heritage Edition examples were finished in Brittany Blue Metallic with optional Wimbledon White side and painted over-the-top stripes. Exterior features include a louvered hood, HID headlights, heated mirrors, Cobra puddle lamps, a rear wing, and LED taillights with sequential turn signals. The Carbon Fiber Track Pack added front splitter wickers and a manually adjustable carbon-fiber rear wing.",
      "Exposed carbon-fiber 20″ seven-spoke wheels are mounted with 305/30 front and 315/30 rear Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires. The car is equipped with four-wheel independent suspension and a MagneRide damping system. Stopping power is provided by six-piston front and four-piston rear Brembo brake calipers fitted over two-piece ventilated rotors. The Carbon Fiber Track Pack added adjustable strut top mounts.",
      "The Recaro front seats are trimmed in Ebony leather and suede with Dove accents and are complemented by a carbon-fiber instrument panel. The rear seats were deleted as part of the Carbon Fiber Track Pack, and amenities include a SYNC 3 infotainment system with an 8″ touchscreen, dual-zone automatic climate control, cruise control, and Ford Track Apps. The Technology Package included a 12-speaker Bang & Olufsen sound system, voice-activated navigation, and BLIS blind-spot monitoring. Factory-installed plastic floor protectors line the foot wells.",

      "The Alcantara- and leather-wrapped multifunction steering wheel features a gray centering stripe and paddle shifters and frames a configurable 12″ LCD instrument panel. Analog oil pressure and oil temperature gauges are mounted in the center stack. The steering wheel center is covered by factory-installed protective plastic. The digital odometer indicates 8 miles.",
      "The hand-assembled 5.2-liter Predator V8 was factory rated at 760 horsepower and 625 lb-ft of torque and features an inverted roots-type supercharger, an air-to-liquid intercooler, and an engine oil cooler as well as a plaque bearing the engraved signature of the engine builder.",

      "This 1999 Porsche 911 Carrera cabriolet was specified in Zenith Blue Metallic over Savannah Beige all-leather, and it was specified with a body-color removable hardtop, power-adjustable front seats, and a remote six-disc CD changer. It is powered by a 3.4-liter M96 flat-six paired with a six-speed manual transaxle, and further equipment includes a dark blue soft top, a deployable rear spoiler, 18″ Sport Design wheels, a Kenwood infotainment screen with navigation, cruise control, and automatic climate control. The seller purchased the car in June 2022, and it has 61k miles. This 996.1 cabriolet is now offered at no reserve with a service invoice, the owner’s manual, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Alabama title in the seller’s name.",
      "The car is finished in Zenith Blue Metallic and is equipped with a color-matched removable hardtop and a dark blue convertible soft top as well as integrated fog lights, a deployable rear spoiler, and dual exhaust outlets with polished finishers. A cable line on the convertible top was repaired in October 2022. Paint imperfections are noted along with cracked front-end protective film. Photos depicting paint imperfections as well as paint-meter readings are provided in the gallery.",
      "The 18″ Sport Design wheels show signs of curb rash and are mounted with Michelin Pilot Sport tires showing date codes from 2021. Braking is handled by four-piston Porsche-branded calipers fitted over cross-drilled rotors at all four corners which are said to have been serviced in October 2023. The front lower control arms and sway bar links were reportedly replaced in May 2024. There is an infrequent rattle originating from the front-left wheel.",
      "The cabin features seating surfaces trimmed in Savannah Beige leather, which are accented by a color-coordinated dashboard and door panels. Amenities include eight-way power-adjustable front seats, driver-seat memory settings, stainless-steel door sill plates, a Kenwood Excelon infotainment screen with navigation, a Hi-Fi sound system, a remote six-disc CD changer, cruise control, and automatic climate control. The right-rear window regulator was replaced in October 2022.",
      "The leather-wrapped steering wheel fronts a 180-mph speedometer, a central tachometer, and gauges for coolant temperature, oil pressure, voltage, and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 61k miles, approximately 4k of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The 3.4-liter M96 flat-six was factory rated at 296 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. The spark plugs were replaced in May 2022.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed manual transaxle. The clutch was reportedly replaced in October 2023.",

It is finished in Arctic Silver Metallic over black leather, and features include 17″ two-piece Targa wheels, a power-operated glass roof panel, power-adjustable front seats, supple leather seat inserts, a Blaupunkt Bremen SQR-46 stereo, a Hi-Fi sound system, cruise control, and air conditioning. This 993 Targa is now offered on dealer consignment with a window sticker, the owner’s manual, service records, a car cover, and a clean California title.",
      "The 993 Targa was based on the convertible bodyshell and featured a revised roof with a lifting and sliding glass center section as opposed to the removable top found on earlier 911 Targa models. This example is finished in Arctic Silver Metallic and features headlight washers, fog lights, power-adjustable mirrors, a speed-activated rear spoiler, and stainless-steel dual exhaust outlets. The Targa roof panel was repaired in June 2019, and the windshield was replaced in June 2024. The Carfax report lists accident damage in an undated entry, and the selling dealer notes that the rear bumper cover has been refinished. Paint blemishes are noted.",
      "Targa-specific two-piece 17″ Speedline wheels show signs of curb rash and are mounted with Yokohama Advan Fleva tires that were installed in December 2020. Braking is handled by Porsche-branded calipers over cross-drilled rotors at all four corners. The steering rack, tie rods, and the left-front wheel bearing were replaced in June 2019, and the struts were replaced in June 2024.",
      "The seating surfaces are trimmed in black leather with supple inserts, and they are complemented by an aluminum shifter and handbrake lever. Amenities include power-adjustable front seats, driver-seat lumbar support, a Blaupunkt Bremen SQR-46 stereo, a Hi-Fi sound system, cruise control, air conditioning, and stainless-steel sill plates.",
      "The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames VDO instrumentation including a central tachometer with a 6,800-rpm redline, a 180-mph speedometer, an analog clock, and gauges for oil pressure, oil temperature, oil level, and fuel level. The six-digit odometer shows 76k miles, approximately 10k of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The air-cooled 3.6L M64 flat-six features a VarioRam intake system and was factory rated at 282 horsepower and 250 lb-ft of torque. The cylinder heads were machined and the engine resealed in June 2019, and additional work at that time included replacing the spark plugs, ignition wires, the ignition rotor, the distributor cap, the secondary air check valve, and the cut-off valve. An oil change was performed in January 2024, and the battery was replaced in preparation for the sale.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels via a six-speed manual transaxle. The clutch disc, pressure plate, and the clutch release bearing were replaced in June 2019.",
      "The window sticker lists initial delivery to Beverly Hills Porsche in Los Angeles, California, along with standard equipment, options, and a total price of $79,866.",
      "The Carfax report lists the aforementioned unreported accident."

    "description": [
      "This 2008 Lamborghini Gallardo Superleggera was initially delivered in Japan and was acquired by the selling dealer and imported to Canada in 2023. The car was subsequently modified by converting the six-speed gearbox to a manual setup and removing the front differential so that power from the 5.0-liter V10 is directed exclusively to the rear wheels. The car is finished in Grigio Telesto over black Alcantara and is equipped with a rear wing, 19″ Scorpius wheels, fixed-back bucket seats, dual-zone automatic climate control, and a replacement head unit with Bluetooth and Apple CarPlay. This Gallardo Superleggera now has 30k kilometers (~19k miles) and is offered by the selling dealer with Ontario registration.",
      "The Gallardo was initially styled by Italdesign Giugiaro, while the final production version was designed in-house by Luc Donckerwolke. The Superleggera is equipped with a carbon-fiber rear diffuser, rear decklid, mirror housings, and side skirts in addition to a thinner windshield and polycarbonate in place of various standard glass panels. This example is finished in Grigio Telesto and features xenon headlights, power-folding side mirrors, and dual exhaust outlets that exit through the rear valance.",
      "Scorpius 19″ wheels are mounted with 235/35 front and 295/30 rear Michelin Pilot Sport 4s tires that were installed in June 2023, per the seller. Braking is provided by black-finished calipers with Lamborghini script over cross-drilled and ventilated rotors at all four corners. The optional front-axle lift system does not work.",
      "The interior houses fixed-back seats upholstered in black Alcantara that extends to the dashboard and headliner. Carbon-fiber trim accents the center console and door panels. A gated shifter was fitted as part of the manual gearbox conversion. A replacement head unit with Bluetooth and Apple CarPlay was installed in 2023.",
      "The Alcantara-wrapped steering wheel frames a 340-km/h speedometer, a 10k-rpm tachometer, and gauges for coolant temperature and fuel level. A three-gauge panel mounted atop the dashboard includes readouts for oil pressure, oil temperature, and voltage. The seller notes that the check engine light intermittently illuminates. The digital odometer indicates 30k kilometers (~19k miles), approximately 5k of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The 5.0-liter V10 was factory rated at 523 horsepower and 376 lb-ft of torque. The seller reports that the spark plugs, ignition coils, and water pump were replaced in 2022 prior to the car’s importation.",
      "The car left the factory equipped with a six-speed automated transaxle and an all-wheel-drive system. A conversion to rear-wheel drive that involved removing the front differential was completed in 2023, and the gearbox actuator, shifter, and pedals were replaced at that time to convert the system to a manual setup.",
      "The Carfax report shows no accidents or other damage since an initial entry in June 2023."

Finished in Carrara White over black leather and Alcantara, the car is equipped with the Sport Chrono and Sound Plus packages, silver 19″ alloy wheels, bi-xenon headlights, a sunroof, an adjustable rear wing, heated adaptive sport seats, automatic climate control, and PCM 3.0 with extended navigation. This 997.1 GT3 is offered by the selling dealer in Texas with service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean North Carolina title.",

This example is finished in Carrara White and features a sunroof, auto-dimming mirrors, rain-sensing wipers, and bi-xenon headlights with washers. The front license plate bracket was removed and factory-style fog lights and taillights were installed in April 2024.",

Braking is handled by red Porsche-branded six-piston front and four-piston rear calipers over 13.8″ rotors. The GT3 was factory equipped with Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM) featuring adjustable coilovers. The brake fluid was flushed in July 2023.",

Interior amenities include the Sound Package Plus, automatic climate control, cruise control, red seatbelts, and Porsche Communication Management (PCM) 3.0 with extended navigation. The air conditioning system was recharged in April 2024.",
      "The Alcantara-wrapped steering wheel frames a central GT3-branded tachometer with an 8,400-rpm redline as well as a 225-mph speedometer and gauges for coolant temperature, oil temperature, oil pressure, and fuel level. The optional Sport Chrono Package added a stopwatch atop the dashboard. The digital odometer indicates 6k miles. The Carfax report shows that the steering column was replaced in October 2023.",
      "The 3.6-liter Mezger flat-six features VarioCam variable valve timing as well as titanium connecting rods and dry-sump lubrication. It was factory rated at 415 horsepower and 300 lb-ft of torque. The battery was replaced in July 2023 and service in April 2024 involved changing the drive belt and coolant pipe and hoses as well as flushing the coolant.",

It is finished in Willow Green over tan leather and is powered by a 4.2-liter inline-six linked with a four-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential. Equipment includes triple SU carburetors, exhaust headers, a black soft top, a louvered clamshell hood, four-wheel disc brakes, 15″ wire wheels, a wood-rimmed steering wheel, and a retro-style radio. This XKE roadster is now offered on dealer consignment with a Jaguar Heritage Trust Certificate, service records, Jaguar club literature, and a clean Arizona title.",

      "The wood-rimmed steering wheel frames Smiths instrumentation including a 160-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 5k-rpm redline as well as an analog clock and gauges for voltage, oil pressure, coolant temperature, and fuel level. The five-digit odometer shows 85k miles, approximately 2k of which were added under current ownership. The speedometer was repaired in 2014, and the total mileage is unknown.",
      "The 4.2-liter inline-six was rebuilt in 2013 and is fitted with triple SU carburetors and tubular headers. The thermostat and drive belts were replaced in January 2023.",

      "This 1985 Mazda RX-7 GSL remained registered in Pennsylvania until it was acquired by the seller on BaT in January 2023, and it now shows 82k miles. Powered by a 1.1-liter 12A rotary paired with a five-speed manual transmission, the car is finished in Desert Brown Metallic over brown leather upholstery. Equipment includes a limited-slip differential, a sunroof, 13″ alloy wheels, four-wheel disc brakes, power windows, cruise control, and an AM/FM cassette stereo with a graphic equalizer. Work performed in 2022 consisted of replacing the front brake pads and rotors, and the seller states that the starter and clutch hydraulic cylinders were replaced under current ownership. This RX-7 is now offered with a clean Carfax report and a clean West Virginia title in the seller’s name.",
      "The car is finished in Desert Brown Metallic (T9) and features a removable sunroof panel, pop-up headlights, power-adjustable side mirrors, a rear window wiper, and a power antenna. The left door was reportedly repainted under prior ownership and an area of rust is noted in the rear window channel.",
      "Four-spoke 13″ alloy wheels are mounted with 185/70 Kenda Kenetica tires. Braking is handled by power-assisted four-wheel discs, and the pads and rotors were replaced in October 2022.",
      "The cabin features seats upholstered in brown leather with a color-coordinated dashboard and carpeting. Additional appointments include cruise control, power windows, a heated rear window, and an AM/FM cassette stereo with a graphic equalizer. The air conditioning and Quartz clock are inoperative.",
      "The three-spoke leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a 140-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 7k-rpm redline as well as gauges for oil pressure, voltage, coolant temperature, and fuel level. The six-digit odometer shows 83k miles, under 1k of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The 1.1-liter 12A Wankel rotary was factory equipped with a four-barrel carburetor and was rated at 101 horsepower and 107 lb-ft of torque, which is is routed to the rear wheels via a five-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential. The engine oil and air filter were changed in October 2022, and the radiator was reportedly replaced under previous ownership. The seller states that a replacement starter and clutch hydraulic cylinders were installed following their acquisition.",
      "Additional underside photos are viewable in the gallery below.",
      "The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage."

      "This 2005 Audi S4 Avant was acquired by the seller in 2019 and subsequently fitted with a remanufactured 4.2-liter V8 and was serviced with metal-reinforced timing chain guides. It is finished in Arctic White over black leather and beige Alcantara upholstery, and power is sent to all four wheels via a six-speed manual transaxle and a Quattro all-wheel-drive system. The car is equipped with 18″ Avus wheels, a sunroof, roof rails, heated power-adjustable Recaro front seats, dual-zone automatic climate control, a Pioneer head unit, and a Bose sound system. This S4 Avant has 140k miles and is offered with service records, a clean Carfax report, and transferable Vermont registration in the seller’s name.",
      "The car is finished in Arctic White with aluminum roof rails as well as body-color side moldings. Additional details include a sunroof, fog lights, headlight washers, tinted windows, a rear spoiler, and dual exhaust outlets. The seller states a rearview camera has been added and the factory adaptive headlights have been replaced with non-adaptive units. Repaired paint chips are noted, and close-up photos of blemishes along the body can be seen in the gallery.",
      "Replacement 18″ Avus wheels were refinished in 2020 and are mounted with Yokohama Advan Sport A/S tires. Stopping power is provided by four-wheel vented disc brakes, and various components of the sport-tuned suspension have been replaced under current ownership according to the seller.",
      "The heated and power-adjustable Recaro front seats are upholstered in black leather and beige Alcantara, while carbon-fiber trim accents the center console. Equipment includes driver’s seat memory settings, cruise control, dual-zone automatic climate control, a Pioneer head unit, and a Bose sound system.",
      "The leather-wrapped multifunction steering wheel frames a 170-mph speedometer and an S4-branded tachometer flanked by auxiliary gauges. The digital odometer indicates 140k miles, approximately 40k of which were added during current ownership. The Carfax report notes the instrument panel was repaired in 2005, and the seller reports a warning light related to the headlamps is illuminated.",
      "The 40-valve 4.2L V8 was replaced at approximately 106k miles with a remanufactured unit by Pacific German of Laguna Hills, California, in February 2020. Additional work at that time included installing metal-reinforced chain guides as well as replacing the rear timing chain guide rail, valve cover gaskets, intake manifold gaskets, rear main seal, fuel injectors, engine mounts, ignition coils, and oxygen sensors. The engine was modified with a Revotechnik Stage 2 ECU tune at that time. An oil change was performed in March 2024.",
      "An invoice from February 2020 lists the installation of an “OEM remanufactured long block” and subsequent part number. Additional records for services performed under current ownership total over $30k and are shown in the gallery.",
      "Power is sent to all four wheels through a six-speed manual transaxle and a Quattro all-wheel-drive system. The clutch disc, flywheel, and slave cylinder were replaced in 2020. Additional photos of the underside are provided in the gallery.",
      "The Carfax report shows no accidents or other damage.",
      "The car does not have a title, as it is registered in a state that does not issue titles for a vehicle of its age. It is being sold on its registration."

      "This 1973 Pontiac Firebird Formula was refurbished in 2023 and is finished in white with blue stripes over black and blue upholstery. It is powered by a rebuilt 350ci V8 linked to a Turbo Hydra-Matic three-speed automatic transmission and rides on a coilover suspension and 15″ snowflake-style wheels. Equipment includes twin hood scoops, front and rear spoilers, aftermarket headlights, power-assisted front disc brakes, Flowmaster mufflers, and an Edelbrock intake manifold along with front bucket seats, air conditioning, and an aftermarket head unit and speakers. Acquired by the seller in 2024, this Firebird Formula is offered with a clean Nevada title in the name of the seller’s trust.",
      "The exterior was disassembled before being repainted in white with blue stripes, and photos taken during the process are provided in the gallery. The weather seals and glass is said to have been replaced. Details include front and rear spoilers, dual hood scoops, an Endura front bumper, aftermarket headlights, and quad exhaust outlets. Close-up photos of the paint, trim, and panel fitment are provided in the gallery.",
      "The 15″ honeycomb-style wheels are mounted with Mastercraft Avenger G/T tires. The car rides on a coilover suspension and tubular control arms, and it is equipped with power steering. Braking is provided by front discs and rear drums.",
      "Sound-deadening material was applied during the refurbishment, after which the headliner, sun visors, door panels, carpets, and dashboard were replaced and the front buckets and split rear seats were reupholstered in black vinyl with blue cloth inserts. Appointments include a center console, air conditioning, and a retro-look stereo linked to aftermarket speakers. The dome light does not work.",
      "The Formula steering wheel fronts a machine-turned dashboard fascia housing a 160-mph speedometer. The five-digit odometer shows 71k miles, and the seller states that less than 500 miles have been added since completion of the refurbishment.",
      "The 350ci V8 was rebuilt under prior ownership, and it is equipped with an Edelbrock intake manifold and valve covers along with an MSD ignition coil.",
      "Power is routed to the rear wheels through a Turbo Hydra-Matic three-speed automatic transmission. The dual exhaust system features an H-pipe midsection and Flowmaster mufflers, and the frame was refinished during the build.",
      "The current Nevada title notes an exempt odometer brand."

      "This 2016 BMW M235iR is one of a limited number of factory-built race cars sent to the US, and it was purchased new by the seller and used in World Racing League and SCCA events. The car is finished in white with Motorsport stripes and white #6 roundels, and power comes from a replacement 3.0-liter N55 inline-six mated with a paddle-shifted eight-speed Steptronic automatic transmission and a limited-slip differential. It was modified with the installation of the M240iR conversion package, the Hot Climate package, GT4 wing endplates, an M4 auxiliary radiator, an off-road exhaust system, and a Motorsport EVO suspension with solid heim joint control arms. Additional equipment includes an air jack system, motorsport-tuned Dynamic Stability Control, and antilock disc brakes with PFC front calipers as well as 18″ BBS wheels, an adjustable carbon-fiber rear wing, a rearview camera, a roll cage, air conditioning, a Cool Shirt system, an OMP racing seat, a Motorola radio, an AiM data logger. This M235iR is now offered on a bill of sale in Stilwell, Kansas, with service records and a clean Carfax report.",

A replacement front bumper, grille, hood, and underbody panel were installed in March 2019, and additional equipment includes carbon-fiber mirror caps, a rearview camera, and an adjustable carbon-fiber rear wing with GT4 endplates as well as a rear tow strap and dual exhaust outlets.",
      "Black-finished 18″ split-spoke BBS wheels are mounted with Michelin Pilot Sport slicks. The car is equipped with an air jack system as well as motorsport-specific versions of ABS, Dynamic Stability Control, and Automatic Stability Control. The suspension was modified with Motorsport EVO solid heim joint control arms, and replacement rear air jacks were installed in April 2021. Braking is handled by PFC four-piston fixed calipers up front and two-piston calipers at the rear.",
      "The cockpit features a carbon-fiber transmission tunnel, footwells, and door panels with pull straps in addition to a factory 2-series dashboard. An AiM camera is affixed to the top of the dash, and additional equipment includes a Motorola radio, a Cool Shirt system, and an OMP racing seat with a racing harness.",
      "An Alcantara-wrapped steering wheel with an integrated gear indicator and shift lights frames a 160-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 7k-rpm redline. The digital odometer indicates 10k miles, all of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The replacement turbocharged 3.0-liter N55 inline-six was installed in March 2019, and the turbocharger was replaced that May. Additional service performed in June 2020 included replacing the DME, water pump, and primary radiator and installing an M4-specification auxiliary radiator.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a paddle-shifted ZF eight-speed automatic transmission as well as a replacement limited-slip differential that was installed in April 2021. A replacement transmission cooler was fitted in July 2020.",
      "The seller has reportedly won nine WRL races in the GTO class with the car, including the 2018 championship race. It is also said to have notched eight first-place finishes at SCCA Hoosier Super Tour events as well as second place at the 2020 SCCA runoffs.",

      "This 1966 Ferrari 330 GT 2+2 is one of approximately 460 Series II examples produced between 1965 and 1967 and was completed around August 1966. Chassis 8845 is said to have been purchased and placed in storage by its second owner in 1971 before being sold to the selling dealer in 2013. Subsequent work included a repaint in silver, replacement of the exhaust system, and a rebuild of the servo-assisted disc brakes. Power is provided by a 4.0-liter Colombo V12 that breathes through triple Weber carburetors and is mated to a five-speed manual transmission. Additional features include a limited-slip differential, servo-assisted four-wheel disc brakes, coil-spring suspension with Koni shock absorbers, 15” Campagnolo center-lock wheels, red leather upholstery, and power windows. This 330 GT 2+2 is now offered by the selling dealer at no reserve with invoices from current ownership, a tool kit, and a clean California title.",
      "The 330 GT was designed as a longer-wheelbase successor to the 330 America and debuted at the Brussels Motor Show in January 1964 with Pininfarina styling featuring a rounded rear profile with wraparound taillight assemblies and a quad-headlight front fascia. Revisions for the model’s second series in 1965 included single headlights, three-louver fender vents, and bumpers with rubber-lined overriders.",
      "This example was stripped to bare metal and repainted in silver during a refresh performed between 2017 and 2021, which also included metalwork on various panels. The front bumpers and overriders were replaced during the project, as were various glass and body seals. Features include a Talbot driver-side mirror, front and rear quarter vent windows, and quad ANSA exhaust outlets.",
      "The Campagnolo wheels were media-blasted and powder-coated in silver during the refresh, at which time 205VR15 Pirelli Cinturato tires were mounted. Stopping is handled by servo-assisted disc brakes with a dual-circuit master cylinder and a single Dunlop booster. Work performed under current ownership included rebuilds of the calipers, turning of the rotors, and replacement of the master cylinder and hoses.",
      "The cabin is trimmed in red leather over the 2+2 seating as well as over the door panels and console, while contrasting black upholstery covers the dash and door caps. Additional features include red carpeting, color-keyed lap belts, a Pininfarina-branded ashtray, a wood dash fascia hosting a lockable glovebox, and power windows.",
      "The wood-rimmed steering wheel sits ahead of Veglia instrumentation including a 300-km/h speedometer, an 8k-rpm tachometer, and gauges monitoring oil temperature and oil pressure. The five-digit odometer shows 34k kilometers (~21k miles), less than 1k of which have been added under current ownership. A quartet of instruments to the driver’s right includes a clock and gauges monitoring coolant temperature, amperage, and fuel level.",
      "The 4.0-liter Colombo Tipo 209 V12 breathes through triple Weber carburetors and was factory rated at 300 horsepower. The carburetors were cleaned and synced during the refresh under current ownership.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels via an all-synchromesh five-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential. Suspension incorporates an independent front setup and a leaf-sprung solid-axle rear end, with coil springs and Koni telescopic shock absorbers at all four corners.",
      "There is currently a lien on the car, and the owner’s lender will need to be paid off before the title can be transferred to the new owner."

      "This 1985 Ferrari Testarossa was delivered new in Germany and modified by Koenig Specials in 1986 with their Competition Evolution II conversion, which included installation of revised bodywork along with a KCE 1000 Turbotronic twin-turbo kit. The car subsequently spent time with a second owner in Germany prior to being relocated to Japan, where it remained with its third owner until 2009 before being acquired by the selling dealer’s client and brought to the US in 2023. The modified Koenig Specials bodywork incorporates updated fascias, vented fenders, side air intakes, and a raised rear wing along with fixed headlights, louvered taillights, and a plexiglass engine cover. Inside, power-adjustable bucket seats trimmed in red leather are accompanied by Schroth four-point harnesses along with a MOMO steering wheel, Koenig-branded instrumentation, a boost-control dial, and a custom stereo. The 4.9L F113A flat-12 is fitted with twin KKK turbochargers, side-mounted intercoolers, a MoTeC engine management system, and a center-exit exhaust system. Shifting is through a five-speed manual transaxle with a limited-slip differential, and further equipment includes Koni shocks, H&R springs, AP Racing disc brakes, and 17″ multi-piece alloy wheels. A timing belt service is said to have been performed in preparation for the sale, and the car now shows 17k kilometers (~11k miles). This Koenig Specials–modified Testarossa is offered on dealer consignment in California with a clean Montana title.",
      "Koenig Specials is a German tuning company that was founded by privateer racer Willy König in 1977 in Munich, West Germany. The company began by modifying contemporary Ferrari Berlinetta Boxer models before turning their attention to the Testarossa upon its release in 1984. Following the debut of a Koenig Specials–modified Testarossa at the 1985 Frankfurt Motor Show, the company would go on to offer various upgrade packages for the car including their Competition, Competition Cabrio, and Competition Evolution conversions.",
      "A later Competition Evolution II example, this car is finished in red and features revised fascias, vented fenders, side air intakes, a plexiglass engine cover, and a raised rear wing. Fixed headlights are paired with louvered taillights, and dual polished central exhaust outlets exit from the bodywork at the rear. A Koenig Specials decal is affixed to the windshield, while Koenig Turbo graphics appear ahead of the rear wheels.",
      "The 17″ multi-piece wheels feature gold centers and are mounted with 235/45 Michelin Pilot Sport 4 tires up front and 335/35 Pirelli P-Zero Asimmetrico rubber out back. The car rides on Koni shocks fitted with H&R springs, and braking is handled by AP Racing calipers over two-piece slotted rotors at all four corners.",
      "The power-adjustable bucket seats are trimmed in red leather, which extends to the dash, center console, and doors. The seats are accompanied by Koenig-branded Schroth four-point harnesses as well as retractable three-point seatbelts. A Sony AM/FM cassette stereo is connected to Quart speakers, and further appointments include a digital clock, a defroster, and power windows.",
      "The leather-wrapped MOMO steering wheel is paired with a gated dogleg shifter and frames Koenig-branded instrumentation including a 360-km/h speedometer and a 10k-rpm tachometer flanked by oil and boost pressure gauges. A MoTec C125 digital display is located atop the center stack, which also houses a six-digit Veglia Borletti mechanical odometer that indicates 17k kilometers (~11k miles).",
      "A boost-control dial on the dash allows the driver to select between various power-output levels.",
      "The mid-mounted 4.9L F113A flat-12 was fitted with a Koenig Specials KCE 1000 Turbotronic kit in 1986, according to the selling dealer. Koenig Specials rated the engine for 1,000PS in Evolution trim. The engine is equipped with twin KKK turbochargers, side-mounted intercoolers, oil coolers, Turbosmart external wastegates, a MoTeC engine management system, and a modified center-exit exhaust system.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a five-speed manual transaxle and a limited-slip differential.",
      "The Carfax report is free of accidents or other reported damage from a single entry in April 2024."

Service in August 2023 included replacing the battery, tires, and upper radiator hoses. This 550 Maranello is now offered in Colorado by the selling dealer with a clean Carfax report and a clean Montana title.",

Equipment includes projector-style headlights, fog lights, a hood scoop, a front spoiler, front fender vents, and quad exhaust tips exiting through the rear bumper cover. A paint-correction was performed and a ceramic coating was applied to the body in August 2023, at which time a clear paint-protection film was applied to the front.",

    "description": [
      "This 1954 Citroën 11BL is said to have remained with the family of its original owner until the current owner’s acquisition in 2012 following several decades of storage. Subsequent refurbishment work involved stripping the body to bare metal and repainting it in black, reupholstering the interior, and rebuilding the 1.9-liter inline-four and three-speed manual transaxle. Equipment includes metric steel wheels, rack-and-pinion steering, torsion-bar suspension, and front-wheel-drive with homokinetic drive axles. This Traction Avant is now offered on dealer consignment in New Hampshire with refurbishment records, manufacturer’s literature, and a clean California title.",
      "The car was dismantled and the steel unibody was stripped to bare metal before a repaint in black during the aforementioned refurbishment. Exterior details include a louvered hood, a tilt-out windshield, coach front doors, and aluminum stone guards. Paint imperfections are displayed in the video below.",
      "Cream-finished 400mm steel wheels have chrome center caps and are mounted with 165-series Michelin X tires. The torsion-bar suspension features independent front wishbones and rear trailing arms linked to a beam axle and a panhard bar. The car is equipped with rack-and-pinion steering, and braking is handled by four-wheel drums that were overhauled in 2013.",
      "Sound-deadening material was added to the cabin floors and inner doors before the interior was retrimmed in gray vinyl and cloth. Laps belts are provided for front occupants, and holes in the headliner are shown up close in the gallery.",
      "The two-spoke steering wheel fronts a 150-km/h Jaeger speedometer with an inset fuel gauge and ammeter, while metric gauges for oil pressure and coolant temperature have been added on the left side of the dashboard. The five-digit odometer shows 2,100 kilometers (~1,300 miles), which is said to represent the distance added since completion of the refurbishment. Total mileage is unknown.",
      "The 1.9-liter inline-four is mounted longitudinally behind the transaxle and features a single Solex carburetor. The engine was rebuilt in 2013, and the battery was replaced in preparation for the sale.",
      "Power is sent to the front wheels through a three-speed manual transaxle. Replacement drive axles with homokinetic outer joints were installed during the refurbishment along with a diaphragm-style clutch pressure plate.",
      "Photos taken at various stages of the refurbishment are presented in the gallery."

      "This 2005 Ferrari 612 Scaglietti is powered by a 5.7-liter V12 paired with a six-speed transaxle that was converted to manual operation in October 2023. Finished in Blu Mirabeau over Beige Tradizione leather upholstery, it is equipped with 18″ and 19″ five-spoke alloy wheels, xenon headlights, a gated shifter, heated and power-adjustable front seats, a CD stereo, and dual-zone automatic climate control. Additional work at the time of the gearbox conversion included changing the oil and coolant, installing H&R sway bars, and servicing the air-conditioning system along with repairing sticky interior buttons and replacing the timing and serpentine belts, clutch, engine and transmission mounts, battery, and more as detailed below. Following registration history in California, New Jersey, and New York, the vehicle was acquired by the selling dealer in June 2024. With 18k miles, this 612 Scaglietti is now offered with owner’s manuals, a tool and spares kit, service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Pennsylvania title.",
      "The Pininfarina-designed 612 Scaglietti was the first V12-powered Ferrari to move from steel to aluminum-intensive construction. This example is finished in Blu Mirabeau and features xenon headlights, heated side mirrors, rear parking sensors, and quad exhaust outlets. The panel under the left-side exhaust outlets was repaired in 2023.",
      "Five-spoke alloy wheels measuring 18″ up front and 19″ out back are mounted with 245/45 and 285/40 Pirelli P Zero tires, respectively. Braking is handled by black-finished calipers over cross-drilled and ventilated rotors. H&R sway bars have been added, and the steering-rack boots and power-steering hoses were replaced in October 2023.",
      "The heated and power-adjustable front seats are upholstered in Beige Tradizione leather with Cavallino Rampante headrest embossments, and the lower dashboard, center console, door panels, and individual rear seats are trimmed to match. Additional appointments include a gated shifter, a factory CD stereo, drilled aluminum pedals, front-seat position memory, and dual-zone automatic climate control. Work in October 2023 included repairing sticky interior buttons, evacuating and recharging the air-conditioning system, and replacing the leather headliner and the battery-cover panel.",
      "The replacement power-adjustable, leather-wrapped steering wheel frames instrumentation consisting of a 220-mph speedometer, a central 10k-rpm tachometer, and a configurable digital display. The digital odometer indicates 18k miles, approximately 300 of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The 5.7-liter DOHC V12 was factory rated at 533 horsepower and 434 lb-ft of torque. A replacement timing-belt kit was installed in October 2023, and additional work at that time included changing the oil, flushing the coolant, and replacing the following:",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels via a six-speed transaxle, which was converted to manual operation in October 2023 at European Auto Group of Austin, Texas. The clutch and thrust bearing were replaced at that time, and the rear transmission cover was resealed.",
      "The window sticker lists initial delivery to Ferrari San Francisco in California, factory colors and equipment, and a total suggested retail price of $269,697.",
      "The Carfax report is free of accident or damage entries and it notes an open manufacturer recall from September 2022."

      "This 1963 Jaguar XKE Series I coupe was repainted green and fitted with a replacement 4.2-liter inline-six under prior ownership. The car was purchased by the current owner after it was listed on BaT in January 2022, and subsequent refurbishment work has included interior repairs, rear suspension and fuel-system overhauls, a rebuild of the clutch master cylinder, and installation of a RetroSound stereo, an aluminum radiator, and triple SU carburetors. The car also has four-wheel disc brakes, chrome 15″ knock-off wire wheels, GAZ adjustable shocks, glass headlight covers, and a stainless-steel dual exhaust system. This Series I XKE is now offered on dealer consignment with a Jaguar Heritage Trust Certificate copy, service records, spare parts, and a clean Michigan title.",
      "The body was repainted in green during previous ownership, and exterior features include split chrome bumpers, triple windshield wipers, glass headlight covers, and dual exhaust outlets. There are paint and chrome blemishes noted in close-up photos provided in the gallery below.",
      "Dayton chrome 15″ knock-off wire wheels are mounted with 185-section Vredestein Sprint Classic tires, and adjustable GAZ shocks have been installed. The car is equipped with four-wheel disc brakes, and service in 2023 included repairing the rear suspension mounting points and replacing the inner tie rods as well as the shock-absorber and pivot-rod bushings.",
      "The cabin is trimmed in green and features textured aluminum trim on the dashboard and center console. The low-back bucket seats wear replacement leather covers and lap belts with Jaguar logos. The door panels, center console upholstery, and carpet padding were replaced in 2023 and a Bluetooth-capable RetroSound stereo was installed.",
      "The wood-rim steering wheel frames Smiths instrumentation including a 160-mph speedometer and a 6k-rpm tachometer with an inset clock. The five-digit odometer shows 32k miles, under 300 of which were added under current ownership. True mileage is unknown.",
      "The 4.2-liter inline-six was installed during previous ownership and was fitted with triple SU carburetors in 2023. A Howe aluminum radiator was also installed under current ownership, and the fuel pump, fuel tank, and fuel lines were repaired.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a four-speed manual transmission. The clutch master cylinder was rebuilt and the differential seals were replaced in 2023, and the car has a stainless-steel ClassicFabs exhaust system.",
      "Images showing various stages of the work performed following the current owner’s acquisition are presented in the gallery.",
      "A reproduction chassis tag has been installed, and the frame has been re-stamped.",
      "A copy of the Jaguar Heritage Trust certificate displays factory colors and equipment as well as a manufacture date in March 1962. The certificate notes that the body and chassis number do not align."

Equipment includes a three-speed manual transmission, overdrive, a retractable soft top, a 12-volt electrical system, 15″ wheels, chrome brightwork, an AM radio, and a Mustang II-sourced independent front suspension with disc brakes. This Jeepster is now offered at no reserve by the seller on behalf of the owner with a clean California title.",

      "This ’32 Ford hot rod is a fiberglass-bodied roadster that is powered by a 350ci Chevy V8 linked to a TH350 three-speed automatic transmission. The engine features aluminum cylinder heads, a COMP camshaft, and a Holley electronic fuel injection system. Finished in black over tan upholstery, the car rides on a custom-fabricated frame equipped with a dropped front axle, four-link rear suspension, and front disc brakes. Other highlights of the build include a louvered steel hood, Sid Chavers BopTop, Dolphin white-dial instrumentation, Unisteer rack-and-pinion steering, 15” and 16” wire wheels, and a Ford 9” rear end with a limited-slip differential. Acquired by the current owner in 2020, this Deuce highboy is now offered on dealer consignment with a clean Wyoming title that describes the car as a 1932 Ford.",
      "The fiberglass body and tubular steel frame were sourced from Kilbourne Rod Shop, and a steel hood and grille shell were added. The exterior is finished in black with tan pinstriping, and other details include a removable Sid Chavers BopTop, a chopped windshield, teardrop taillights, and chrome spreader bars.",
      "Wheelsmith 15” front and 16” rear wire wheels wear polished hubcaps and are mounted with 185/65 and 285/60 BFGoodrich tires, respectively. The suspension features a dropped front axle with a transverse leaf spring, while the solid rear axle is located via a four-link setup and equipped with adjustable coilovers. Unisteer rack-and-pinion steering has been installed, and braking is handled by front discs and rear drums.",
      "The cabin features a bench seat trimmed in beige vinyl upholstery with color-coordinated door panels. Pinstriping accents the body-color dashboard, and additional appointments include a heater, black carpets, and lap belts.",
      "A banjo-style steering wheel is mounted to a tilting column and sits ahead of an AutoMeter 8k-rpm tachometer, while an engine-turned bezel houses Dolphin white-dial instrumentation consisting of a 140-mph speedometer and auxiliary gauges. The six-digit odometer shows 12k miles, approximately 1k of which have been added under current ownership.",
      "The 350ci Chevy V8 is equipped with aluminum Edelbrock cylinder heads, a COMP camshaft, a Holley Sniper electronic fuel injection system, and an MSD distributor. Short-tube exhaust headers flow into a dual exhaust system with Magnaflow mufflers, and a 14-gallon fuel cell is mounted in the trunk along with the battery. The Walker radiator is cooled by a SPAL electric fan.",

      "This 2000 Ducati 996 was first registered in Massachusetts, and it later spent time in Rhode Island and Quebec, Canada, before it was re-imported to the United States and acquired by the seller in March 2023. Finished in yellow, the bike is powered by a 996cc desmodromic L-twin paired with a six-speed transmission. It also features Marelli fuel injection, a single-sided aluminum swingarm, adjustable suspension, triple disc brakes with Brembo calipers, and five-spoke 17″ Marchesini wheels as well as a clear windscreen, a biposto tail section with a black-upholstered rider seat and a yellow-upholstered passenger seat, and a dual exhaust system with Termignoni carbon-fiber mufflers. This 996 shows 20k miles and is offered with a clean Iowa title in the seller’s name.",
      "The bike wears Massimo Tamburini-designed bodywork and is finished in yellow, and the seller states that several panels were refinished under current ownership. Features include a gray-finished trellis frame, a clear windscreen, a side stand, rear-set foot controls, a biposto tail section with a black-upholstered rider seat and a yellow-upholstered passenger seat, and a side stand in addition to a full fairing that features a clear windscreen, dual mirrors, symmetrical headlights, and DZUS fasteners.",
      "Gray-finished 17″ five-spoke Marchesini wheels wear a Continental tire up front and a Michelin tire out back that bear production date codes from 2013 and 2017, respectively. Adjustable Showa suspension consists of a 43mm inverted fork in addition to a piggyback monoshock connected to the single-sided aluminum swingarm. Braking is from gold-finished Brembo calipers mounted over a pair of drilled rotors up front along with a single Brembo caliper and drilled disc at the rear.",
      "Clip-on handlebars are secured beneath an upper triple clamp that anchors a hydraulic steering damper, which is attached to the right side of the frame. Instrumentation consists of a 180-mph speedometer, a 13k-rpm tachometer, and a coolant temperature gauge. The five-digit odometer shows 20k miles, approximately 100 of which have been ridden by the seller.",
      "The liquid-cooled 996cc L-twin features Marelli fuel injection, four desmodromically actuated valves per cylinder, and a dual exhaust system fitted with a pair of Termignoni carbon-fiber mufflers that exit beneath the tailpiece. The oil was changed under current ownership.",
      "Power is routed to the rear wheel through a multi-plate dry clutch, a six-speed transmission, and a drive chain.",
      "The Iowa title identifies the motorcycle model as a “996 S.”"

      "This 1974 Cadillac Eldorado Convertible was acquired by the selling dealer in 2023 and subsequent work consisted of replacing the white leather upholstery. Power is provided by a 500ci V8 paired with a three-speed automatic transmission, and the car is finished in Cranberry Firemist over white leather upholstery. Equipment includes a power-operated white convertible soft top, power steering, power front disc brakes, power windows, automatic climate control, cruise control, Twilight Sentinel automatic headlights, and a power-adjustable front bench seat as well as 15″ steel wheels with polished covers. This Eldorado Convertible is now offered at no reserve with a clean Arizona title.",
      "The car left the factory in Cranberry Firemist (99) and was repainted under prior ownership. Details include a power-operated white convertible soft top, a two-piece hard parade boot, fender-mounted light monitors, cornering lights, and rear fender skirts. The selling dealer notes that the power-operated top requires manual assistance to raise and lower.",
      "The 15″ steel wheels wear polished covers and are mounted with 235/75 Cooper Trendsetter SE white-stripe tires, that were reportedly installed in 2021. Stopping power is provided by front disc and rear drum brakes. The Eldorado featured a torsion bar front suspension and a coil-sprung solid rear axle along with Automatic Level Control and power steering.",
      "The bench seats were retrimmed in white leather upholstery under current ownership, and the front unit is power-adjustable. Patterned woodgrain trim accents the dash and door panels, and further appointments include automatic climate control, cruise control, a digital clock, Twilight Sentinel automatic headlights, and power windows and door locks.",
      "The three-spoke steering wheel wears a woodgrain cover and frames a 100-mph speedometer and a fuel level gauge. The five-digit odometer shows 66k miles, approximately 1k of which were added by the selling dealer.",
      "The 500ci V8 features a Rochester Quadrajet four-barrel carburetor for a factory output of 210 horsepower and 380 lb-ft of torque. Power is sent to the front wheels through a Turbo Hydra-Matic three-speed automatic transmission."

The selling dealer purchased the car in 2021 and has since added approximately 3k of the 27k indicated miles. This 981 Cayman GTS is now offered by the selling dealer with spare parts, two keys, a clean Carfax report, and a clean California title.",

      "This 1969 Kaiser-Jeep M725 is a 1¼-ton ex-military ambulance that is finished in green over green vinyl upholstery and powered by a 230ci inline-six linked to a four-speed manual transmission and a dual-range transfer case. Ambulance-specific equipment includes accommodations for up to five stretchers, a surgical lamp, air ventilators, a gas heater, rear-access steps, and a sliding door between the cab and the rear compartment. The truck also has intake and exhaust snorkels, a grille guard, body-color bumpers, a spotlight, red-cross graphics, green-painted 16″ wheels, and manually locking front hubs. The selling dealer acquired the vehicle in 2023. This M725 is now offered in California at no reserve with a bill of sale.",
      "Produced from 1967 through 1969, the M725 ambulance was based on Kaiser-Jeep’s M715 military truck, which itself was based on the contemporary Jeep Gladiator pickup and offered a 1¼-ton load rating. This example is finished in olive drab green, and a large red-cross graphic spans swing-out rear doors that hold jerrycans. Other features include US Army lettering above the rear doors, body-color bumpers, intake and exhaust snorkels, a grille guard, D rings, dual side mirrors, and a spotlight. A storage compartment is provided ahead of the left-rear wheel.",
      "Green-painted 16″ steel wheels are wrapped with 9.00–16LT Denman military nylon-cord tires that exhibit cracks. Selectro manually locking hubs are found at the front axle. The truck has leaf springs, telescoping shocks, and drum brakes at all four corners.",
      "The cab houses two seats upholstered in green vinyl. An electric fan is mounted above the windshield, a turn-signal controller is attached to the steering column, and the interior also contains a passenger-side grab bar and a glovebox. Discoloration is noted on the passenger seat.",
      "The two-spoke steering wheel fronts central instrumentation including a 60-mph speedometer and gauges for fuel level, water temperature, oil pressure, and voltage. The five-digit odometer shows 2k miles, and true chassis mileage is unknown.",
      "The rear compartment can hold up to five medical stretchers and offers a surgical lamp, air ventilators, a gas heater, and rear-access steps. A sliding door separates the cab from the rear compartment.",
      "The 230.5ci Tornado inline-six features a single-overhead-camshaft design combined with hemispherical combustion chambers. The selling dealer performed a tune-up in preparation for the sale.",
      "Power is delivered to the rear or all four wheels through a four-speed manual transmission and a dual-range transfer case.",
      "The vehicle does not have a title, as it is not intended for road use and has not been registered for the street. It is being offered on a bill of sale."

Acquired by the selling dealer in 2023, this modified Camaro Z28 convertible shows 118k miles and is offered with a clean Carfax report and a clean South Carolina title.",
      "The car was modified with bodywork resembling a first-generation Camaro and refinished in yellow with black decals under previous ownership. Exterior details include a black convertible soft top, a cowl induction hood, and a decklid spoiler.",
      "Black 17″ and 18″ wheels feature silver lips and are mounted with 245/45 Westlake SA-07 tires up front and 285/35 Lexani LXUHP-207 rubber out back. Braking is handled by four-wheel ventilated discs with ABS.",
      "The front bucket seats and contoured rear seats are trimmed in graphite leather with yellow houndstooth inserts. Appointments include a power-adjustable driver seat, air conditioning, cruise control, a Delco CD stereo, and power windows and locks.",
      "The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a 150-mph speedometer, a 7k-rpm tachometer, and gauges for voltage, oil pressure, fuel level, and coolant temperature. The six-digit odometer shows 118k miles, approximately 1,500 of which were added by the selling dealer.",
      "The 5.7-liter LT1 V8 was factory rated at 275 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque.",

      "This 1946 Ford Super Deluxe coupe is said to have been delivered new to Jim Bush Ford in Ashland, Oregon, and has remained with the same owner since 1957. A refurbishment in the 2000s involved re-trimming the interior in white and installing a 239ci flathead V8 joined to a three-speed automatic transmission and an 8” rear end. Power-assisted four-wheel disc brakes were also added along with a Mustang II front suspension. Other equipment includes an Offenhauser intake manifold, dual Holley 94 carburetors, Edelbrock cylinder heads, American Racing 15” wheels, exhaust headers, and an electric trunk lid popper. This Super Deluxe coupe is now offered on dealer consignment at no reserve with manufacturer’s literature, a workshop manual, and a clean Oregon title.",
      "The car was repainted in black in the 1990s and features a split windshield, a red-accented grille, aftermarket supplementary turn signals, and a rear bumper embossed with a Ford emblem. The trunk lid hardware has been shaved, and an electric popper is operated with a switch inside the fuel filler door. Delamination is visible in the pop-out quarter windows, and bubbling paint, cracks, and blemishes around the car can be viewed in the gallery. The listing photos were taken in 2023.",
      "This is a relist after the vehicle was listed on BaT in November 2023 and withdrawn due to a leak from the transmission, which has since been repaired. The associated record is provided in the gallery.",
      "American Racing Torq Thrust 15” wheels are mounted with older BFGoodrich Radial T/A tires that measure 205/60 up front and 275/60 out back. The suspension has been lowered and modified with a Mustang II subframe and coilovers up front. Braking is handled by power-assisted discs at all four corners with Wilwood rear calipers. The brakes were adjusted in preparation for the sale, and cracks in the tires are noted.",
      "The cabin has been reupholstered in white, and black carpets line the floors. Custom pinstriping adorns the black dashboard, which houses an AM radio and a clock. The sun visors are missing, and discoloration and wear on the interior surfaces can be viewed in the gallery along with pitting on the interior brightwork.",
      "The Grant steering wheel fronts a 100-mph speedometer and inoperative auxiliary gauges, while AutoMeter supplementary gauges have been added below the dash. The oil pressure gauge does not work, and a secondary unit has been mounted in the engine compartment. The five-digit odometer shows 9k miles. Total mileage is unknown.",
      "The 239ci Flathead V8 is said to have been sourced from a 1951 Mercury and is equipped with an Offenhauser intake manifold, dual Holley 94 carburetors, and finned Edelbrock cylinder heads. Tubular headers flow into a dual exhaust system with polished finishers, and the drivetrain electrical system has been converted to 12-volt operation. Work performed in preparation for the sale has reportedly included rebuilding the carburetors and repairing the radiator. The selling dealer notes that the choke mechanisms are not hooked up, and the electric pusher fan for the radiator must be operated manually while driving.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a C4 three-speed automatic transmission and an 8” rear end. A transmission cooler has been mounted to the underside of the passenger floor.",
      "A workshop manual and manufacturer’s literature will accompany the car.",
      "Historical images are presented in the gallery."

This 600 is offered by the selling dealer in Canada with a tool kit and Ontario registration.",
      "Unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show in March 1955 as the successor to the 500 Topolino, the Fiat 600 was the company’s first rear-engined car and was produced through 1969 at the Mirafiori assembly facility in Turin, Italy. This first-year example is finished in gray and was repainted some time ago. The vented engine cover wears a Fiat 600 badge, and further details include sliding side windows, rear-hinged doors, and polished bumpers.",
      "Ivory-finished 12″ steel wheels wear polished Fiat-branded hubcaps and are mounted with 5.20″ whitewall tires. A full-size spare is stored in the front trunk compartment.

      "This 1969 Plymouth Barracuda convertible was acquired by the seller around 2013 and was subsequently refurbished with installation of a 5.7-liter Hemi V8 and a five-speed automatic transmission as well as a repaint in orange with black stripes and trim. Other features include an AlterKtion K-member, power-assisted rack-and-pinion steering, Wilwood front disc brakes, five-spoke 17″ wheels, a TTi dual exhaust system, a black convertible top, a rear wing, black leather front seats, power windows, power locks, a push-button starter, aftermarket gauges, air conditioning, a Pioneer Mixtrax touchscreen infotainment system, and an aftermarket audio system. The transmission’s computer was replaced in preparation for the sale. This modified Barracuda is now offered with service records and a clean Arizona title in the name of the seller’s spouse.",
      "Plymouth manufactured 1,442 Barracuda convertibles for 1969. This example is said to have been refinished in orange around 2016, and the black convertible top has been replaced. Features include black stripes on the hood as well as black bumpers, a black grille, black trim, black windshield-wiper arms, a black driver-side mirror, a black rear wing, a black tail panel, a chrome flip-up fuel cap, and chrome dual tailpipes. Touch-up paintwork has been performed, and the rear-window alignment to the top and the door on the passenger side is imperfect.",
      "The 17″ wheels have black spokes, bright lips, and Retro-branded center caps. Pirelli Cinturato P7 tires measure 205/50 in front and 225/50 at the rear. An AlterKtion front K-member connects to Viking Performance front coilovers, a front anti-roll bar, and power-assisted rack-and-pinion steering. The power-assisted braking system is composed of Wilwood front discs paired with rear drums.",
      "Front bucket seats sourced from a Chrysler 300 are trimmed in black leather and have Chrysler logos in the seatbacks. The rear seats also are upholstered in black, and seatbelts are provided for four occupants. A center console from a Chrysler 300 has been added along with aftermarket air conditioning, a push-button starter, power windows, power locks, and a Pioneer Mixtrax touchscreen head unit. The air conditioning was serviced in 2023.",
      "An aftermarket three-spoke steering wheel frames aftermarket instrumentation consisting of a 140-mph speedometer, an 8k-rpm tachometer, and gauges for oil pressure, water temperature, fuel level, and battery voltage. The digital odometer indicates approximately 50 miles. Total mileage is unknown.",
      "The battery has been relocated to the trunk compartment, which also houses a JL Audio subwoofer and a Kenwood amplifier.",
      "The 5.7-liter Hemi V8 is said to have been sourced from a Chrysler 300 and installed by the seller. A K&N air filter and exhaust headers are fitted, and the car has been rewired. The engine bay was repainted more recently than the rest of the vehicle, according to the seller. The car’s chassis number indicates that it was originally powered by a 318ci V8.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through an NAG1 five-speed automatic transmission that was rebuilt and installed under current ownership. The transmission’s computer was replaced in May 2024."

Finished in Canna di Fucile over Beige Tradizione Connolly leather, it is equipped with a limited-slip differential, 17″ five-spoke alloy wheels, a gated shifter, pop-up headlights, power-adjustable front seats, automatic climate control, and a factory stereo linked with a CD changer. The car was sold on BaT in June 2020 before being imported to the US later that year, and it was acquired by the selling dealer in 2024. Work in preparation for the sale is said to have included a timing belt service and replacement of the rear shocks and nitrogen spheres. This 456 GT is offered in New York with an owner’s manual, a tool kit, an accident-free Carfax report, and a clean Connecticut title.",
      "The Pininfarina-designed aluminum and composite bodywork is finished in Canna di Fucile and features pop-up headlights, integrated fog lights, and polished quadruple exhaust tips exiting through the rear valance. HID headlights were installed under previous ownership.",

Self-adjusting dampers and self-leveling rear suspension were standard equipment. Stopping power is provided by Ferrari-branded four-piston brake calipers over ventilated rotors at each corner. The rear shocks and nitrogen spheres were replaced in preparation for the sale.",

An analog clock and gauges for fuel level, coolant temperature, oil pressure, and oil temperature are located in the center stack. The six-digit odometer shows 16k kilometers (~10k miles). The Carfax report indicates that an “Exceeds Mechanical Limits” title was issued in 2021, and total mileage is unknown.",
      "The 5.5-liter F116 V12 features four valves per cylinder, Bosch Motronic fuel injection, and dry-sump lubrication.

The selling dealer notes that a timing belt service was performed in preparation for the sale along with a coolant flush.",

      "This 1932 Ford Model B was purchased by the current owner in 2008 as a project without a body. Subsequent work included installing fiberglass Tudor bodywork from Gibbon and fiberglass fenders from Wescott as well as a 201ci inline-four that was rebuilt with an Alexander OHV head, dual Stromberg 97 carburetors, and a Datsun dual-coil distributor. The car is also equipped with hydraulic brakes, tube shocks, 16″ wire wheels, a steel Rootlieb hood, and a three-speed manual transmission with 1939 Ford gears. The cabin retains a three-spoke steering wheel and has been fitted with lap seatbelts, Stewart-Warner gauges, and a Model T-style “ahooga” horn. This Model B is now offered by the seller on behalf of the current owner with service records and a clean Washington title in the owner’s name.",
      "The car was acquired by the current owner as a frame with a firewall, and it was then fitted with an unpainted Tudor body from Gibbon Fiberglass. The fenders and grille shell are also unpainted fiberglass and were sourced from Wescott’s Auto. Additional work included installing a 20-louver steel hood from Rootlieb after it was painted black, and the car is further equipped with turn signals, dual taillights, and sideview mirrors.",
      "Black-painted wire wheels wear chrome hubcaps and are mounted with 6.00–16 front and 7.00–16 rear Firestone bias-ply tires. The Model B rides on a 106″ wheelbase and features front and rear transverse leaf springs. This example is equipped with tube shocks and four-wheel hydraulic drum brakes.",
      "The cabin features front seats trimmed in gray cloth, and additional equipment includes lap belts and a Model T-style “ahooga” horn mounted between the front seats. Un-upholstered rear bench seat springs are installed, and the car is not fitted with a headliner or carpets.",
      "The three-spoke steering wheel fronts a dash with an engine-turned panel housing a Stewart-Warner 160-mph speedometer and auxiliary gauges, while additional readouts are positioned in front of the driver and a tachometer is mounted under the dash to the left of the steering column. The odometer shows 650 miles, representing the distance the car has been driven since completion of the build.",
      "The 201ci inline-four was built in 2009 by Jay Steel of Taylor, California. It features an Alexander Automotive Engineering OHV cylinder head, a counterweighted crankshaft, full-pressure oiling, dual Stromberg 97 carburetors, a Datsun-sourced dual-coil distributor, and a finned valve cover. The radiator is equipped with an electric cooling fan. An invoice for the engine build can be seen in the gallery.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels via a three-speed manual transmission that consists of a 1932 case and 1939 Ford gears.",
      "The car is titled in Washington as a 1932 Ford Tudor, and the title carries a 2008 “Classic” brand from the state."

It is finished in white over black leather and Arctic Grey Race-Tex and is powered by a 4.0-liter flat-six paired with a seven-speed PDK dual-clutch transaxle. Equipment includes a Bose surround-sound system, CFRP full bucket seats, dual-zone automatic climate control, and PCM with navigation. The current owner purchased the car new and it now has 19 miles. This 718 Cayman GT4 RS is now offered in California on dealer consignment with a clean Carfax report and a clean Georgia title.",

    "description": [
      "This 1961 Porsche 356B coupe was originally delivered to Competition Motors of Hollywood, California and reportedly remained registered to the same family for the last five decades. The car is powered by a replacement 1.6-liter flat-four paired with a four-speed manual transaxle and is finished in Signal Red over black leatherette. Features include 15″ steel wheels, a louvered decklid, a sunroof, dual bullet-style side mirrors, vent windows, an AM/FM radio, and front bucket seats. This 356B coupe is now offered at no reserve by the selling dealer with a copy of the Kardex, the owner’s manual, service records beginning in 1968, spare parts, and a clean Colorado title.",
      "The T5 body was introduced for the 1960 model year with revised front-end styling, including raised bumpers and headlights along with a redesigned front trunk lid handle. This Reutter-built example came finished from the factory in Signal Red (6011) and was repainted in 1981, at which time the left rocker panel was repaired. The rear bumper was replaced and the rear end repaired following an accident in 2005. Equipment includes a louvered decklid, a sliding steel sunroof, bullet-style side mirrors, a windshield washer system, body-color bumpers, and “Super 90” badges. The passenger vent window has been replaced. There are blemishes on the bumpers.",
      "The 15″ vented steel wheels wear Deluxe hubcaps and are mounted with Continental ContiProContact tires measuring 175/65. The car was factory equipped with drum brakes at each corner. The brakes are soft.",
      "The front bucket seats and rear jump seats have been reupholstered in black leatherette, and interior appointments include a Blaupunkt AM/FM radio, lap belts, and a body-color painted dashboard.",
      "The three-spoke steering wheel features frames green-letter VDO instrumentation including a 120-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 5,500-rpm redline as well as a combination gauge for oil temperature and fuel level. The five-digit odometer shows 47k miles, and total mileage is unknown.",
      "The replacement 1.6-liter flat-four was installed in the late 1960s and is equipped with dual two-barrel carburetors missing the air cleaners. A leakdown test from October 2023 is viewable in the gallery. The seller notes a strong fuel smell while driving and states that the carburetors need adjustment.",
      "Power is routed to the rear wheels through a four-speed manual transaxle. The seller states that the shifter is worn and requires new bushings. A hole has been cut in the front battery box area as shown in the gallery.",
      "The copy of the Kardex lists the factory colors, serial numbers, and a build date of January 26, 1961."

Equipment includes a Weber carburetor, a performance muffler, front disc brakes, 14″ Minator wheels, a luggage rack, a wood-rimmed steering wheel, a Kenwood Bluetooth stereo, and a cabin heater.

      "This 1977 Ford F-250 Custom 4×4 pickup was delivered new to Wilson Motors of Corvallis Oregon, and it was registered in Tennessee before it was acquired by the selling dealer in 2024. Powered by a 400ci V8 linked with a three-speed automatic transmission and a dual-range transfer case, the truck is finished in two-tone metallic green over green vinyl and cloth upholstery. Equipment consists of 16″ alloy wheels, manually locking front hubs, a headache rack, a bed-mounted storage box, a four-barrel Edelbrock carburetor, and a fabricated dual exhaust system. This F-250 Custom is now offered in Oregon with a Deluxe Marti report and a clean Tennessee title.",
      "This long-bed Styleside example was finished in Light Jade Green (R) from the factory, and it was repainted in the same shade with a Dark Jade Metallic roof and accents circa 2019, according to the selling dealer. Exterior details include a headache rack, a bed-mounted storage box, dual towing mirrors, a sliding rear window, a chrome front bumper, an aftermarket locking fuel door, black spray-on bedliner, a steel rear bumper with a lowered tow ball, and aluminum bodyside moldings with vinyl inserts. Paint bubbles are visible around the roof drip rails, and additional photos of exterior imperfections are viewable in the gallery below.",
      "The 16″ alloy wheels are mounted with 315/75 Mudstar Radial M/T tires. The truck is equipped with manually locking front hubs and power steering, and braking is provided by power-assisted front discs and rear drums. There are areas of corrosion on the wheels.",
      "The cab features a bench seat upholstered in green vinyl with cloth inserts as well as a color-coordinated upper dashboard pad and door panels. Additional details include a heater, a gun rack, a glove box, and camouflage-pattern floor coverings. There are cracks in the top of the dashboard, the stereo has been removed from the dashboard, the fabric on the right side of the bench is torn, and a section of the trim on the left side of the bench is missing.",
      "The two-spoke steering wheel frames an 85-mph speedometer as well as gauges for coolant temperature, oil pressure, battery charge status, and fuel level. The five-digit odometer shows 58k miles, a handful of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The 400ci V8 has been fitted with an Edelbrock four-barrel carburetor and a chrome-plated Edelbrock air cleaner housing. The selling dealer reports that the engine runs roughly until it has warmed up.",
      "Power is sent to the rear or all four wheels through a three-speed Cruise-O-Matic automatic transmission and a dual-range transfer case. The truck has been fitted with a fabricated dual exhaust system that terminates in front of the rear axle.",
      "The Deluxe Marti Report lists colors, equipment, and production statistics."

      "This 1991 BMW M5 has remained registered in California since new and is finished in Sterling Silver Metallic over black Nappa leather upholstery. Powered by a 3.5-liter S38 inline-six paired with a five-speed manual transmission, the car has been fitted with Bilstein dampers, H&R springs, and a Dinan ECU chip. Additional equipment includes 17″ M System I wheels with “turbine” covers, a limited-slip differential, a sunroof, heated power-adjustable front sport seats, and dual-zone air conditioning. It was acquired by the selling dealer in 2023, and work performed in preparation for the sale included adjusting the valves and replacing the valve cover gasket, distributor cap and rotor, spark plugs, tires, front control arms, thrust arms, shock mounts, rear trailing arm links, and tie rods. This E34 M5 has 168k miles and is offered at no reserve with spare parts, a window sticker, service records, manufacturer’s literature, an accident-free Carfax report, and a clean California title.",
      "The car is finished in Sterling Silver Metallic (244) and features fog lights, a sunroof, dual exhaust outlets, and a revised front air dam, rear valance, and rocker panels when compared to the standard E34. There are dings on the front doors and paint chips around the body. Close-up photographs of the exterior finish and trim are shown in the gallery below.",
      "Factory 17″ M-System I wheels feature directional turbine-style covers and are fitted with Toyo Proxes Sport tires that were mounted in 2024. Bilstein dampers and H&R springs have been added, and the self-leveling rear suspension has been removed. Braking is handled by four-wheel ventilated discs with ABS. Work completed since 2023 included changing the brake fluid and power steering fluid and replacing the front control arms, thrust arms, shock mounts, rear trailing arm links, and tie rods. There are curb marks on the wheels. The factory self-leveling suspension components are included in the sale.",
      "The cabin features black Nappa leather covering the heated power-adjustable front sport seats as well as the door panels and center console. An obsolete mobile phone remains housed in the center console, and amenities include cruise control, a Sony head unit, an onboard computer, and dual-zone air conditioning, the latter of which was recharged in preparation for the sale. The selling dealer states that the rear door panels are delaminating.",
      "The steering wheel frames a 180-mph speedometer, an 8k-rpm tachometer, and gauges for oil temperature, coolant temperature, and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 168k miles, approximately 900 of which were added by the selling dealer.",
      "The 3.5-liter S38B36 inline-six features dual-overhead camshafts along with individual throttle bodies and was factory rated at 310 horsepower and 266 lb-ft of torque. Work performed since 2023 included changing the oil, adjusting the valves, and replacing the valve cover gasket, distributor cap and rotor, spark plugs, and exhaust hangers. A Dinan ECU chip has been added.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a Getrag 280/5 five-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential. The transmission is said to have been replaced in 2019, and work completed during the selling dealer’s ownership included changing the transmission fluid and replacing the transmission mounts. The seller states that the vehicle passed a California emissions test in June of this year.",

      "This 1967 Jaguar XKE Series I roadster was purchased by the owner in 1974 and was the subject of a refurbishment that was completed in 2014. It is powered by a 4.2-liter inline-six linked to a four-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential. Finished in Opalescent Maroon over tan leather, the car is equipped with a black soft top, open sealed-beam headlights, 15″ wire wheels, power-assisted disc brakes, triple windshield wipers, and a heater. This XKE Series I roadster is now offered on dealer consignment with a Jaguar Heritage Trust Certificate, service records, and a clean Pennsylvania title.",
      "The car was refinished in its factory Opalescent Maroon in 2016. Equipment includes a black soft top, sealed-beam open headlights, a louvered clamshell hood, wraparound chrome bumpers, bright trim, a driver-side mirror, triple windshield wipers, and dual exhaust outlets.",
      "The 15″ wire wheels are secured by two-eared knock-offs and are mounted with 205/70X15 Dunlap Signature Ii tires. Braking is provided by four-wheel discs with inboard-mounted rear rotors.",
      "Originally trimmed in black, the cabin was reupholstered in tan leather in the 2010s. Interior appointments include black vinyl dash trim, a sliding rearview mirror, a Blaupunkt radio, and a heater.",
      "The wood-rimmed steering wheel frames a Smiths 160-mph speedometer and 6k-rpm tachometer, while auxiliary gauges for coolant temperature, oil pressure, fuel level, and amperage are located in the center of the dashboard. The five-digit odometer shows 64k miles, approximately 6k of which were added since 1974.",
      "The 4.2-liter inline-six features triple SU carburetors and was factory rated at 265 horsepower and 283 lb-ft of torque. It was rebuilt in 1987 and refreshed again during the 2010s build.",
      "The cylinder head stamp matches the number listed on the Heritage Trust certificate.",
      "Power is routed to the rear wheels through a full-synchromesh four-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential.",
      "The Jaguar Heritage Trust Production Record Trace certificate shows the original colors and drivetrain numbers as well as the build and dispatch dates."

      "This 1980 Suzuki LJ80 4×4 was first sold in Colombia, and it was reportedly refurbished in 2019 before being acquired by the seller in 2021 and imported to the US in 2023. Refinished in yellow over black vinyl, the truck is powered by a 797cc inline-four linked with a four-speed manual transmission and a dual-range transfer case. It also features a Mikuni carburetor, a beige soft top, a white-finished front bumper with yellow-lens auxiliary lights, and black-finished 15″ steel wheels as well as a Suzuki-branded AM radio. Work in August 2023 is said to have included changing the valve cover gasket, oil pan gasket, air filter, oil, and battery. This LJ80 is offered with a 2019 Club Colombiano de Automóviles Antiguos y Clásicos judging sheet, refurbishment photos, and a clean Florida title that lists the truck as a 1981 model.",
      "The body has been refinished in yellow. Features include a beige soft top, a white-finished front bumper with yellow-lens auxiliary lights, and Suzuki-branded rear mud flaps.",
      "Black-finished 15″ steel wheels are mounted with Lima Caucho tires. The truck rides on leaf springs at all four corners.",
      "The front bucket seats and the rear jump seats are trimmed in black vinyl. The body-color steel dashboard houses an AM radio, a passenger-side grab handle, and a glove compartment with a black-finished lockable door.",
      "The two-spoke steering wheel frames a 120-km/h speedometer, gauges for coolant temperature and fuel level, and warning lamps. The five-digit odometer shows 65k kilometers (~41k miles), approximately 5k of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The 797cc inline-four is equipped with a Mikuni carburetor, and it drives the rear or all four wheels through a four-speed manual transmission and a dual-range transfer case. The seller states that the valve cover gasket, oil pan gasket, air filter, and battery were replaced in August 2023, at which time an oil change was performed.",
      "Photos illustrating various stages of the refurbishment can be viewed in the gallery below along with a 2019 Club Colombiano de Automóviles Antiguos y Clásicos judging sheet.",
      "The current Florida title describes the truck as a 1981 model."

Power is supplied by a twin-turbocharged 6.0-liter W12 linked with a six-speed automatic transaxle, an all-wheel-drive system, and a Torsen center differential. The car is finished in Ice over Beluga leather with diamond-stitch Alcantara inserts, and it features 20″ Supersports alloy wheels, an adaptive air suspension, a replacement power-retractable black soft top, xenon headlights, parking sensors, a speed-activated rear spoiler, a backup camera, heated massaging front comfort seats, carbon-fiber interior trim, navigation, a 12-speaker audio system, multi-zone automatic climate control, and cruise control. This Continental Supersports convertible is now offered on dealer consignment with a window sticker, an owner’s manual, a clean Carfax report, and a clean New Jersey title.",
      "The Supersports model is approximately 250lbs lighter than the contemporary Continental GT, and it features Smoked Steel-finished grille meshes, headlight bezels, and trim as well as a revised front fascia, smoked taillight lenses, and flared quarter panels to accommodate a wider rear track. This example is finished in Ice and features a power-operated black soft top that was replaced in 2021 by Bentley of Paramus, New Jersey. Additional equipment includes xenon headlights, front and rear parking sensors, polished trim, a speed-activated rear spoiler, and integrated dual exhaust outlets with polished finishers. There are scrapes on the front bumper cover, and additional photos of the exterior condition are provided in the gallery below.",
      "Black-finished 20″ Supersports 10-spoke alloy wheels are mounted with 275/35 Pirelli P Zero tires that show 2022 production codes. The car is equipped with an adaptive air suspension that includes driver controls for ride height and damper settings. Stopping power is provided by Bentley-branded calipers fitted over ceramic-composite rotors at each corner. The brake fluid was flushed in February 2024. Paint chips are noted on the right-front and left-rear wheels.",
      "Optional heated, massaging, and power-adjustable front comfort seats are trimmed in Beluga leather with diamond-stitch Alcantara seat inserts and Supersports backrest embroidery. Appointments include a dash-mounted Breitling analog clock, carbon-fiber interior trim, a rearview camera, a navigation system, a CD stereo, a 12-speaker audio system, multi-zone automatic climate control, and cruise control.",
      "The multifunction steering wheel sits ahead of column-mounted paddle shifters and frames a 210-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 6,500-rpm redline as well as gauges for coolant temperature and fuel level. The digital odometer indicates 27k miles, approximately 10k of which were added under current ownership.",

      "This 1964 Porsche 356SC coupe was built on March 9, 1964 and spent time in New Mexico and California before being brought to Colorado, where it was purchased by the seller’s father in 1985 before ownership was transferred to the seller in 1991. The car is finished in Light Ivory over a black interior and is powered by a replacement 1.6-liter flat-four paired with a four-speed manual transaxle. Equipment includes 15″ steel wheels, disc brakes, body-color bumpers, twin engine grilles, cloth front bucket seats, a cabin heater, a Blaupunkt cassette radio, and an analog clock. Work in 2024 consisted of adjusting the valves and replacing the glovebox, headlights, spare tire strap, and passenger vent window seal. This 356SC coupe is now offered with a copy of the Kardex, the owner’s manual, service records, a removed set of wheels, and other parts, and a clean Colorado title in the seller’s name.",
      "The Karmann-built body came finished from the factory in Light Ivory (6404) and was repainted in 1997. Features include an underside front tow ring, twin engine grilles, and body-color bumpers with bright guards. Replacement headlights and lenses were installed in 2024. The windshield washer system is inoperative and the seller notes paint imperfections, scratches on the driver’s window, various areas of touch up, and aged window seals. Bubbling and peeling around the body is pointed out in the gallery.",
      "Chrome 15″ steel wheels wear Porsche crest hubcaps and are mounted with Falken ZE912 tires that show date codes from 2010 and measure 195/60. The car was factory equipped with disc brakes at each corner. The seller states that the tires should be replaced. The removed set of wheels and tires is included in the sale.",
      "The front bucket seats were reupholstered in cloth in 1997, while the rear jump seats are trimmed in black leatherette. Interior appointments include a body-color painted dashboard, a cabin heater, lap belts, a Blaupunkt cassette radio, and an analog clock. A reproduction glovebox was installed in 2024 along with a replacement passenger vent window sea. The clock is inoperative, the carpeting on the center tunnel should be replaced, and there are tears on the vinyl behind the rear seats. An aftermarket gas heater is included in the sale.",
      "The three-spoke steering wheel frames VDO instrumentation consisting of a central tachometer with a 5,500-rpm redline as well as a 120-mph speedometer and a combination gauge for oil temperature and fuel level. Auxiliary gauges for oil pressure and voltage have been added below the dash. The speedometer intermittently works and the five-digit odometer shows 29k miles. Total mileage is unknown.",
      "The replacement 1.6-liter 616/16 flat-four was was rebuilt in the late 1980s. A Crane Cams electronic ignition system has been installed. The valves were adjusted in 2024.",
      "Engine stamping KD*P*804237* is shown above, and a corresponding number is listed on the Kardex below the original engine number.",
      "Power is routed to the rear wheels through a four-speed manual transaxle. There are various leaks from the engine and axle boots.",

It also features a four-speed transmission, folding handlebars, street lighting, a right-side mirror, a black and gray vinyl-upholstered solo seat, and a side stand. This Z50J6-YB is offered at no reserve in California for off-road use only with a bill of sale.",

      "This 1993 Ford Mustang SVT Cobra was initially delivered to Prestige Ford-Lincoln-Mercury, Inc. of Richlands, Virginia, and spent time in several additional states before it was acquired by the current owner on BaT in August 2023. Now showing just under 228 miles, the car is finished in black over Opal Grey leather. Power is provided by a 302ci V8 linked with a five-speed manual transmission and a limited-slip differential, and equipment includes a rear spoiler, fog lights, 17″ turbine-style alloy wheels, and a cassette stereo as well as the 250A Preferred Equipment Package, which added air conditioning, front floor mats, and the Power Equipment Group. This Fox-body Cobra is offered with a window sticker, a Deluxe Marti report, an SVT Certificate of Authenticity, a clean Carfax report, and a clean California title in the seller’s name.",
      "The body is finished in black (UA), and the . Features include a decklid spoiler, Cobra badging, fog lights, and polished dual exhaust tips in addition to revised taillights shared with the Mustang SVO.",
      "Turbine-style 17″ aluminum wheels were reportedly mounted with 245/45 Michelin Pilot Sport 3+ tires under previous ownership. Stopping power is provided by power-assisted four-wheel disc brakes, and SVT-specific suspension components included custom-valved Tokico shocks and struts along with revised springs and anti-roll bars. Work in October 2022 is said to have included flushing the brake fluid and power steering fluid as well as resurfacing the rear brake rotors.",
      "The front bucket seats and the rear bench seat are upholstered in Opal Grey leather. Appointments include a factory cassette stereo, door-panel map pockets, and the optional Preferred Equipment Package, which added air conditioning along with power windows, mirrors, and door locks. The driver-seat power-adjustment motor was reportedly replaced in 2020.",
      "The leather-wrapped airbag steering wheel frames a 140-mph speedometer, a tachometer with a 5,900-rpm redline, and gauges for voltage, coolant temperature, oil pressure, and fuel level. The five-digit odometer shows just under 228 miles, approximately seven of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The 302ci OHV V8 features a Cobra-specific upper intake manifold and camshaft as well as a 65mm throttle body, GT40 cast-iron cylinder heads, and aluminum roller rockers. Factory-rated output was 235 horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque. Maintenance under previous ownership is said to have included replacing the fuel filter, changing the oil, and flushing the coolant.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a BorgWarner T5 five-speed manual transmission paired with a Traction-Lok rear axle, the latter of which was reportedly serviced in October 2022.",
      "The included window sticker displays initial delivery to Prestige Ford-Lincoln-Mercury, Inc. of Richlands, Virginia, and it lists factory colors and equipment along with a total price of $21,257. An SVT Certificate of Authenticity, a Deluxe Marti report, and factory literature will also accompany the car.",
      "The Carfax report shows no accidents or other damage and lists history in Kentucky, West Virginia, Illinois, North Carolina, and California from its initial entry in February 2007. According to the seller, mileage discrepancies on the report that were noted in the previous listing were corrected by Carfax in October 2023."

      "This 2007 Porsche 911 Turbo coupe has 7k miles, and it was first delivered to Tom Williams Porsche in Irondale, Alabama. It is finished in Basalt Black Metallic over Terracotta and black leather, and it is powered by a twin-turbocharged 3.6L flat-six that drives all four wheels via a six-speed manual gearbox. Equipment includes the Sport Chrono Package, 19” Turbo wheels, bi-xenon headlights, heated power-adjustable front seats, automatic climate control, and PCM with navigation. This 997.1 Turbo coupe is now offered in New York by the selling dealer with a window sticker, owner’s manuals, service records, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Montana title.",
      "The car is finished in Basalt Black Metallic and features bi-xenon headlights, fog lights, rain-sensing windshield wipers, side air intakes, and flared quarter panels. Photos showing paint-meter readings are included in the gallery.",
      "The 19” Turbo wheels are mounted with Bridgestone Potenza RE050A tires, which show date codes from 2007. Braking is handled by Porsche-branded six- and four-piston front and rear calipers over 13.8″ rotors. The car is equipped with Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM) as well as Porsche Stability Management (PSM) with an automatic brake differential (ABD). The brake fluid was changed in May 2024.",
      "The cabin features heated power-adjustable front seats upholstered in Terracotta supple leather, while black leather adorns the upper portions of the dash and door panels. Interior amenities include driver-seat memory settings, a Bose sound system, automatic climate control, cruise control, and Porsche Communication Management with navigation.",
      "The leather-wrapped steering wheel frames a central tachometer and a 225-mph speedometer as well as gauges for oil temperature, oil pressure, coolant temperature, and fuel level. The optional Sport Chrono Package added a stopwatch atop the dashboard. The digital odometer indicates 7k miles.",
      "The twin-turbocharged and intercooled 3.6-liter Mezger flat-six was factory rated at 480 horsepower and 460 lb-ft of torque. The Sport Chrono Package allows the 997.1 Turbo to overboost for up to 10 seconds, increasing peak rated torque to 505 lb-ft. Power is sent to all four wheels through a six-speed manual transaxle. The clutch pressure accumulator was replaced in August 2019, and the oil was changed and spark plugs were replaced in May 2024.",
      "The window sticker lists initial delivery to Tom Williams Porsche in Irondale, Alabama, along with factory equipment, colors, and a total price of $130,115.",
      "The Carfax report is free from accidents or other reported damage."

      "This 1970 Mercedes-Benz 280SL is finished in red over beige upholstery, and it is powered by a 2.8-liter inline-six mated to a four-speed automatic transmission. Equipment includes a matching hardtop, a black soft top, 14″ steel wheels with painted covers, power steering, four-wheel disc brakes, and a Becker Europa AM/FM radio, The car was brought to Canada from the US approximately 10 years ago, and reportedly underwent a multi-year refurbishment that concluded in 2022. This W113SL was acquired by the seller in 2023 and is now offered with the owner’s manual, records, a hardtop stand, a car cover, and Nova Scotia registration.",
      "The W113 SL was designed by Friedrich Geiger, Béla Barényi, and Paul Bracq and was introduced to the public at the 1963 Geneva Motor Show. This example came finished from the factory in Dark Red (542) and was repainted its current shade of red during the aforementioned refurbishment. Exterior details include a black soft top, split chrome bumpers with overriders, twin exhaust outlets, and US-specification headlights. There are holes in the soft top, though a replacement is included in the sale. Photos of the included red hardtop and replacement Robbins soft top are shown at the end of the gallery.",
      "The 14″ steel wheels are mounted with 185/75 Hankook Optimo H724 tires. The car is equipped with power steering, and braking is provided by power-assisted four-wheel discs.",
      "The bucket seats are trimmed in beige upholstery, and color-coordinated upholstery extends to the door panels and upper and lower dash pads. Interior appointments include an analog clock, hand-crank windows, seatbelts, Coco floor mats, a floor-mounted gear shifter, and a Becker Europa AM/FM radio.",
      "The two-spoke steering wheel features a chrome horn ring and frames a 140-mph speedometer and a tachometer with a 6,500-rpm redline as well as gauges for fuel level, oil pressure, and coolant temperature. The five-digit odometer shows 43k miles, approximately 400 of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The 2.8-liter inline-six is said to be a replacement item, and power is sent to the rear wheels through a four-speed automatic transmission. Fluid changes were performed and replacement filters installed under current ownership.",
      "The data plate decodes as follows:",
      "The vehicle is being sold on its Nova Scotia registration, which serves as the ownership document in Nova Scotia, Canada. The sale does not include a title."

The car has a power-retractable hardtop, 20″ five-spoke alloy wheels, adaptive xenon headlights, Daytona-style seats, and navigation. Carbon-fiber trim and replacement black upholstery and carpeting were added in 2022, and other features include carbon-fiber side skirts, a custom sound system, and a steering wheel with LED shift indicator lights. This 458 Spider has 18k miles and is offered on dealer consignment with service records, accessories, a clean Carfax report, and a clean Indiana title.",

Exterior features include a power-retractable hardtop, adaptive xenon headlights, fog lights, Scuderia Ferrari fender shields, tinted windows, LED taillights, and triple exhaust outlets. Carbon-fiber side skirts have been added. The engine cover struts were replaced in 2021. Rock chips are noted on the car.",

In 2022, the dash, door panels, and upper windshield pillars were reupholstered in black leather and black carpeting and carbon-fiber trim were fitted. A custom sound system was installed at that time and includes Hertz speakers and a subwoofer enclosure behind the passenger seat. The passenger-side airbag was replaced in 2018.",
      "A carbon-fiber and black leather-trimmed steering wheel with LED shift indicator lights was added in 2022. It features paddle shifters, a red engine-start button, and an adjustable manettino that toggles among several traction control and vehicle settings. Instrumentation includes a central tachometer with a 9k-rpm redline flanked by two configurable displays. The digital odometer indicates 18k miles, approximately 17k of which were added under current ownership. The LED lights on the steering wheel show higher revs than actual.",
      "The mid-mounted 4.5-liter F136F V8 features a flat-plane crankshaft as well as dry-sump lubrication, and was factory rated at 562 horsepower and 398 lb-ft of torque. The spark plugs were replaced in 2021. An oil change was performed and the air conditioning system was recharged in April 2024.",

      "The Carfax report notes no accidents or other reported damage.",

      "This 1978 AMC Pacer D/L station wagon is finished in tan with faux woodgrain paneling over tan cloth upholstery and powered by a 258ci inline-six paired with a three-speed automatic transmission. Steel 14″ wheels with full covers are fitted as well as front disc brakes, chrome bumpers, air conditioning, a folding rear bench seat, and a Panasonic eight-track player. The car was reportedly sold new at Jim Marsh Motors in Las Vegas, Nevada, and acquired by the current owner in August 2022. This Pacer wagon is offered at no reserve on behalf of the current owner with a clean California title in the current owner’s name.",
      "The station wagon variant of the Pacer was fitted with a wider rear hatch compared to the standard model, and the D/L trim package added special wheel covers and exterior trim. This example is finished in Sand Tan with faux woodgrain paneling on the sides and rear hatch and features dual power-adjustable side mirrors, roof rails, pop-out rear quarter windows, and chrome bumpers.",
      "Steel 14” wheels wear full covers sporting body-color accents and are mounted with mismatched thin-whitewall tires. The car is equipped with power steering, and stopping power is provided by disc brakes up front and drums out back.",
      "The front bucket seats and folding rear bench are upholstered in tan cloth and are accompanied by color-coordinated door panels and carpets. Additional appointments include woodgrain dashboard trim, sheepskin front seat covers, an analog clock, a Panasonic eight-track player, and air conditioning.",
      "The two-spoke steering wheel fronts a 90-mph speedometer, a fuel-level gauge, a clock, and an array of warning lights. The five-digit odometer shows 47k miles, approximately 2,000 of which have been added under current ownership.",
      "The 258ci inline-six is equipped with a two-barrel carburetor. An oil change was performed under current ownership.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a three-speed automatic transmission that was reportedly rebuilt approximately 4k miles ago.",
      "The car last passed a smog test for the state of California in May 2024."

      "This 1983 Honda ATC 200E Big Red was purchased new by the seller’s uncle and is powered by an air-cooled 192cc four-stroke single that drives the rear axle via a dual-range five-speed transmission with an automatic clutch. The three-wheeler is finished in red and equipped with a black vinyl solo seat, trail lighting, a rear storage compartment, and front and rear cargo racks as well as a Keihin carburetor, both recoil and electric starters, a telescopic fork, silver-finished 9″ aluminum wheels, and drum brakes. Following eight years in storage, the ATC was acquired by the seller in 2023 and received a replacement battery and spark plug in March 2024. This ATC 200E is now offered at no reserve for off-road use only with a bill of sale.",
      "The three-wheeler is finished in red with two-tone blue and white decals accenting the 2.3-gallon fuel tank. Mudflaps are attached to the three plastic fenders, and additional details include front and rear cargo racks, a black vinyl solo seat, trail lighting, a rear storage compartment, a clevis pin hitch, and folding foot pegs. The taillight lens is cracked, the rear fenders are scratched, the rear decals have portions missing, and corrosion is visible on metal surfaces including the fuel tank, frame, and cargo racks.",
      "Silver-finished 9″ aluminum wheels were mounted with 25×12.00″ Nanco knobby tires in 2008. Braking is handled by drums mounted to the front hub and rear axle, and the ATC’s only suspension consists of a leading-axle telescopic fork with black gaiters. The right-rear tire has cracks in the sidewall and corrosion is visible on the wheels and fork lowers.",
      "The chrome handlebar is mounted between a keyed ignition switch and a choke knob. It is equipped with black waffle-pattern grips as well as a thumb throttle on the right and lighting and ignition switchgear on the left. The ATC is not equipped with an odometer or other instrumentation, therefore true mileage is unknown.",
      "The air-cooled 192cc SOHC four-stroke single is equipped with a 22mm Keihin carburetor, both electric and recoil starters, and an exhaust system that exits below the rear bodywork. Work in March 2024 included changing the oil and replacing the battery and spark plug. Scrapes are visible on the clutch cover and corrosion is visible on the exhaust system.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through an automatic clutch, a dual-range five-speed transmission, and an enclosed drive chain.",
      "The ATC does not have a title or registration. It is being sold for off-road use only on a bill of sale."

Model T production ended in 1927, with 81,181 touring-bodied examples produced for the model year. This example was repainted red with black fenders under previous ownership and features a polished radiator surround, a radiator cap thermostat, running boards with Ford-branded step plates, a split-folding windshield, glass wind wings, a black soft top, a single taillight, and a rear reflector.",
      "Red-painted wire-spoke wheels are mounted with Riverside and Bedford bias-ply tires. A matching spare wheel with a Riverside tire is mounted out back. There are areas of paint loss on the wheels, and the Ford-branded center cap is missing from the right-front wheel. The suspension incorporates solid axles and transverse leaf springs, and braking is handled by a band acting on a drum in the transmission.",
      "The cabin features front and rear bench seats trimmed in black tufted upholstery along with color-matched door panels. A black Ford-branded mat covers the front floors, while black carpeting is fitted out back.",
      "The four-spoke steering wheel sits ahead of column-mounted controls for the throttle and spark advance, while a hand lever and three pedals control the brakes and gear selection. A black skull head handle sits atop the shifter. An ammeter is mounted in the center of the dash. The car is not equipped with an odometer, and mileage is unknown.",
      "The 177ci inline-four is painted blue and features a 12-volt electrical system with an electric starter and an aftermarket air cleaner.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels via a two-speed planetary gear transmission and a Ruckstell rear axle.",
      "The car is titled by the VIN pictured on the replacement plate above, MT1490247. The Washington title lists a Classic brand."

Equipment includes 21″ AMG five-spoke alloy wheels, Airmatic air suspension, a sunroof, bi-xenon headlights, fog lights, running boards, a receiver hitch, Parktronic parking sensors, heated and ventilated multi-contour front seats, heated second-row seats, a Harman Kardon LOGIC7 sound system, cruise control, tri-zone automatic climate control, Keyless Go, and COMAND infotainment with navigation. This X164 GL550 is now offered in New Jersey by the selling dealer at no reserve with the owner’s manual and a clean California title.",
      "The truck is finished in Arctic White (650) and features bi-xenon headlights with Active Curve Illumination as well as a power sunroof, a power-operated liftgate, a receiver hitch, headlight washers, fog lights, brushed aluminum running boards, power-operated rear quarter windows, LED daytime running lights, Parktronic front and rear parking sensors, and a rear window wiper. The Carfax report notes damage in a June 2019 entry. Paint blemishes are shown up close in the gallery.",
      "The 21″ AMG five-spoke alloy wheels are mounted with Continental CrossContact tires that show date codes from 2022. The truck is equipped with an Airmatic dual-control semi-active air suspension system, and braking is handled by disc brakes at all four corners.",

Amenities include driver-seat position memory settings, heated second-row seats, third-row seating, a rearview camera, a Harman Kardon LOGIC7 sound system, cruise control, tri-zone automatic climate control, Keyless Go, Blind Spot Assist, and COMAND infotainment with navigation.",
      "The leather- and wood-rimmed multifunction steering wheel frames a central multifunction display, a 160-mph speedometer, a 7k-rpm tachometer, an analog clock, and a fuel-level gauge. The digital odometer indicates 50k miles. The tire pressure warning light is illuminated.",
      "The 5.5-liter DOHC V8 was factory rated at 382 horsepower and 391 lb-ft of torque. Power is sent to all four wheels through a seven-speed automatic transmission and a 4MATIC all-wheel-drive system. The spark plugs, transmission fluid, and the transmission pan gasket were replaced in April 2019.",
      "The Carfax report shows the aforementioned damage."

      "This 1950 Vincent Rapide was acquired by the seller in 2015 and a subsequent refurbishment performed by Glenn Bewley of Classic Motorcycle Engineering in Greeneville, Tennessee, was completed in early 2021. Work included overhauling its 998cc OHV V-twin, adjusting the fork damper, cleaning and regreasing the rear frame pivoting assembly and spring boxes, and installing an Amal twin-pull throttle assembly, a Neal Videan V3 clutch, and a Dave Hills center stand. The bike is additionally equipped with a Girdraulic fork, a steering damper, quadruple drum brakes, a stepped two-up seat, a hinged rear fender, and four props, including dual Michael Breeding side stands. This Series C Rapide is now offered with an owner’s manual, a parts catalog, Vincent literature, spare and removed parts, the seller’s refurbishment and service records, marketing materials in which the bike is pictured, and a clean Mississippi title in the seller’s name.",
      "The bike is finished in black over black-painted tubular steel frames, the upper of which does not have a stamped number. The fuel tank was repainted during the refurbishment, and the 24-carat gold pinstriping and Vincent transfers were protectively clear-coated. Additional features include polished stainless-steel fenders, the rear of which is hinged, as well as a pedestrian-slicer number plate, a stepped two-up seat, adjustable rider foot pegs and foot controls, folding passenger foot pegs, and four props consisting of dual Michael Breeding side stands, a rear-wheel stand, and a Dave Hills Tread Down center stand.",
      "Black- and red-center-striped chrome rims measuring 20″ up front and 19″ at the rear are laced to dual drum-brake hubs from a Black Shadow and mounted with Avon Speedmaster MKII front and Safety Mileage MKII rear tires which the seller recommends replacing before riding. Suspension consists of a Girdraulic fork and a triangulated swingarm, both of which are fitted with adjustable Koni dampers.",
      "A flat handlebar equipped with bar-end mirrors, replacement Amal grips, and an Amal twin-pull throttle assembly is clamped ahead of the adjustment knob for a friction plate damper in the steering stem. Instrumentation consists of a Smiths Chronometric 150-mph speedometer from a Black Shadow and a Miller ammeter recessed atop the headlight bucket. The five-digit odometer shows 2,500 miles, approximately 2,300 of which were ridden by the seller. True mileage is unknown.",
      "The 998cc OHV V-twin breathes through a pair of Amal pre-Monobloc carburetors fitted with open velocity stacks as well as a two-into-one exhaust system with down-turned headpipes flowing into a low-mounted Burgess-style muffler. The engine underwent an overhaul at Classic Motorcycle Engineering of Greeneville, Tennessee, that was completed in early 2021 and included:",
      "A detailed invoice for the refurbishment can be viewed in the gallery.",
      "The bike is title using number F10AB12867 stamped on the left engine case.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheel through a Neal Videan V3 wet/dry clutch and a four-speed transmission that is shifted on the right with a one-up, three-down pattern. The drive chain is equipped with a drip-feed oiler that has been disabled."

The Carfax reports list an accident reported in October 2022 with another vehicle that resulted in damage to the rear. The selling dealer states that paintwork has been performed on the left-front wheel arch. Paint meter readings are presented in the video gallery below.",

      "This 1959 Alfa Romeo Giulietta Sprint was delivered new through Hoffman Motor Car Company in New York, and underwent a multi-year refurbishment between 2010 and 2013. Work involved repainting the body, reupholstering the cabin, and replacing various interior and exterior trim components in addition to rebuilding the twin-cam inline-four with a 1.4-liter displacement kit, installing a five-speed manual transmission, and overhauling the suspension. The car is finished in Chevrolet Mariner Blue over white leather upholstery and is further equipped with a single Weber carburetor, finned front drum brakes, Koni shocks, and 15″ aluminum wheels. Previously listed on BaT in October 2021, this Tipo 750B is now offered by the selling dealer in Arizona with photographs and records from the refurbishment along with a clean Oregon title.",
      "The Bertone-styled Giulietta Sprint was unveiled at the 1954 Turin Motor Show, and this late-production 750-Series example features transitional styling elements including grid-style front grilles as well as larger headlight and taillight lenses. The body left the factory finished in Blu Tornado (319), and it was stripped and repainted in Chevrolet Mariner Blue as part of the aforementioned refurbishment. The right rocker panel, rear valance, and quarter panels were replaced at that time.",
      "The 15″ aluminum wheels wear Campagnolo decals and are mounted with 155-series Pirelli Cinturato tires. Stopping power is provided by four-wheel drum brakes, and the fronts are equipped with finned-aluminum drums. Koni shocks have been installed at all four corners, and other components replaced as part of the prior refurbishment include the shock mounts, tie rod ends, upper ball joints, and wheel bearings along with various bushings and brake components.",
      "The cabin houses rebuilt low-back seats trimmed in white leather as well as color-coordinated door panels and blue carpets. Further details include a dash-mounted rear-view mirror, a lockable glovebox, and lap belts. The dash topper is worn.",
      "The two-spoke steering wheel frames a tachometer with an inset oil-pressure gauge flanked by a 120-mph speedometer and a combination gauge indicating fuel level, oil temperature, and coolant temperature. The five-digit odometer shows just over 900 miles, approximately 100 of which have been added by the selling dealer. The instrumentation was refurbished by Palo Alto Speedometer, and total mileage is unknown.",
      "The twin-cam inline-four was rebuilt and modified to displace 1.4 liters at the time of the refurbishment. It is equipped with Carrillo rods, Euro-spec camshafts, forged pistons, and a single Weber carburetor. A custom-made aluminum radiator has also been installed along with a Bendix fuel pump.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels through a five-speed manual transmission that was sourced from a 105-Series coupe.",
      "A collection of photographs from the refurbishment process will accompany the car along with correspondence from Centro Documentazione Alfa Romeo indicating the factory color, identification numbers, and a build date of March 16, 1959."

      "The manually adjustable front seats are trimmed in beige leather, and side-impact airbags are integrated into their outer bolsters. Volvo’s Side Impact Protection System (SIPS), which was introduced on the 850, also utilized reinforced pillars and a honeycomb structure inside the doors.",
      "The cabin has a cassette stereo, which is linked with a CD changer mounted in the trunk. The air conditioning does not work. The six-digit odometer shows 240k miles, approximately 1,500 of which were added under current ownership.",
      "The transverse 2.4-liter inline-five was factory rated at 168 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque. The radiator was reportedly replaced under prior ownership, and a sticker in the engine bay indicates that the timing belt and water pump were replaced in March 2023. The rear main seal, torque converter seal, and engine mounts were replaced in May 2024.",
      "Power is routed to the front wheels through a four-speed automatic transaxle.",
      "The Carfax report shows no accidents or damage. A July 2020 entry states that the vehicle was designated as a Gross Polluter by the State of California."

      "This 1989 Toyota Pickup is a Deluxe example that was purchased new by the seller’s late father. Finished in Light Blue Metallic over blue cloth upholstery, the truck is powered by a 3.0-liter V6 paired with a four-speed automatic transmission and a dual-range transfer case. Equipment includes 15″ split-spoke wheels, power-assisted front disc brakes, manually locking front hubs, a hardshell bed cap, a Pendaliner bedliner, air conditioning, and an Alpine stereo. Acquired by the seller in 2023, this Toyota pickup shows 259k miles and is offered at no reserve with manufacturer’s literature, service records, and a clean Washington title in the seller’s name.",
      "The truck is finished in Light Blue Metallic (8D8) with blue side graphics and a Brahma hard shell bed cap. Additional exterior features include a Pendaliner bedliner, mudguards, halogen headlights, and bright bumpers. A December 2007 entry shows that it was involved in an accident with another motor vehicle, and the following entry states that it was declared a total loss by an insurance company. Close-up photographs of the exterior finish and trim are shown in the gallery below.",
      "This is a relist after the vehicle was previously sold on BaT in May 2024 and the winning bidder failed to follow through with their commitment to purchase. This was not due to any fault with the vehicle. The winner’s participation on BaT has been restricted and their buyer’s fee was not refunded.",
      "Silver 15″ split-spoke wheels are mounted with 235/75 Wild Country Radial XTX tires. The truck is equipped with manually locking front hubs, and braking is handled by power-assisted front discs and rear drums with ABS.",
      "The cabin features a bench seat trimmed in Blue cloth, and equipment includes air conditioning, hand-crank windows, rubber floor mats, and an Alpine CD stereo.",
      "Instrumentation includes a 110-mph speedometer and auxiliary gauges for coolant temperature and fuel level. The six-digit odometer shows 259k miles.",
      "The 3.0-liter 3VZ-E V6 features fuel injection for a factory rating of 150 horsepower and 180 lb-ft of torque. The seller states that the radiator was replaced in 2015, the alternator and battery were replaced in 2018, the drive belts were replaced in 2019, and the valve cover gasket and plenum gasket were replaced in 2020.",
      "Power is sent to the rear or all four wheels through a four-speed automatic transmission and a dual-range transfer case. The transmission fluid was changed in 2019.",
      "The Carfax report shows the aforementioned December 2007 damage and total loss entry. A redacted image of the clean Washington title is presented in the gallery."

      "This 1976 Cadillac Seville is said to have been modified by Moloney of Chicago and spent time in Florida before the seller’s acquisition in 2019 and it now shows 97k miles. This brown-over-brown sedan is equipped with power-assisted brakes and 15″ steel wheels as well as automatic climate control, power-adjustable front seats, and power windows and door locks. Power is provided by a fuel-injected 5.7-liter V8 paired with a three-speed automatic transmission, and work performed in 2023 is said to have included converting the air conditioning system to utilize R134a refrigerant and replacing the air conditioning compressor. This Seville is offered with a clean Ohio title in the seller’s name.",
      "An “Executive Stretch” is said to have been carried out by Moloney of Chicago. The body was finished from the factory in Chesterfield Brown, and the seller states the car was repainted in 2016 with custom pinstriping added in 2021. A color-matched padded vinyl roof is fitted along with a power antenna and coach lights. Various trim components were polished and refinished.",
      "The 15″ steel wheels wear full covers with Cadillac center emblems and are wrapped in 215/75 Custom 428 A/S whitewall tires said to have been installed in 2020. A compact spare tire is stored in the trunk. Power-assisted brakes came standard.",
      "The power-adjustable front seats and a rear bench are trimmed in Buckskin leather and complemented by woodgrain trim accents and a Saddle Brown dashboard.  The cabin is appointed with automatic climate control, rear reading lamps, and power windows, mirrors, and door locks. The air conditioning system was converted to utilize R134a refrigerant in 2023, at which time the air conditioning compressor was replaced. The AM/FM radio does not work.",
      "The three-spoke steering wheel is mounted on a tilting and telescoping column and fronts a horizontal-sweep 100-mph speedometer as well as a fuel gauge. The five-digit odometer shows 97k miles.",
      "The 5.7-liter V8 features speed-density port-injected fuel injection and was factory-rated at 180 horsepower and 275 lb-ft of torque, which is sent to the rear wheels through a Turbo Hydra-Matic three-speed automatic transmission. The engine control module (ECM) and the exhaust system were replaced in 2019, according to the seller. The oil was changed in 2023."

    "description": [
      "This 1955 Lancia Aurelia B24S Spider America is one of just 240 Spiders built during a single year of production and is among 181 configured in left-hand drive. Chassis 1044 was delivered new in the US after being completed on May 27, 1955, and is believed to have spent time under the ownership of a Brooklyn collector before being purchased in 1963 by an Illinois owner whose family retained it for 32 years. In 1995 the car was sold via a Los Angeles dealer to an Italian owner who commissioned a three-year refurbishment that included a repaint of the body and Fontana “low-roof” hardtop in pale blue and a re-trim of the interior in dark blue leather. After three years with a Milanese owner, it was purchased by a California owner who commissioned the installation of a Nardi dual-carburetor intake manifold and Borrani wire wheels before the car’s return to the US. The car made an appearance at the 2005 Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance during the ensuing 14 years in California, after which it returned to Europe and received further mechanical freshening. It was purchased two and a half years ago by its current owner, who has since driven it in the Colorado Grand twice. Powered by a 2,451cc V6 paired with a four-speed manual transaxle, the car also features sliding-pillar front suspension, a De Dion rear axle, and hydraulic drum brakes with inboard rear units. This B24S Spider is now offered at no reserve by the seller on behalf of the current owner with a Lancia Classiche Certificato di Origine, a Centro Storico Fiat certificate, invoices dating back to the 1990s, photos from the 1990s refurbishment, and a clean Montana title in the name of the owner’s LLC.",
      "Unveiled at the 1955 Brussels Motor Show, the B24 Spider variant of the Aurelia featured Pinin Farina-designed coachwork over a shortened version of the chassis utilized by the fourth-series Aurelia GT coupe, with which the Spider also shared its mechanical underpinnings. The Spider was available in both right- and left-hand-drive, or sinistra, configurations and was produced for a single year only before being succeeded by the more conventionally appointed B24 convertible.",
      "Originally finished in Grigio, this example was stripped to bare metal before being repainted in its current shade of Azzurro during the refurbishment performed between the mid-to late-1990s, at which time the Fontana removable hardtop was refinished to match. Styling elements include a panoramic windshield, low-profile doors free of exterior handles, split bumpers, an intake scoop allowing a lower hood line, and a blue convertible top that can be stowed beneath the rear bodywork. The soft top rear window was replaced in 2023.",
      "Borrani wire wheels were trued and balanced during work performed between 2022 and 2023 and are secured by two-eared knock-offs. Michelin X tires measuring 165R400 were mounted during the project. Stopping is handled by hydraulic drum brakes with inboard rear units, and service performed between 2022 and 2023 included replacement of the master cylinder and wheel cylinders as well as turning of the drums.",
      "The cabin was re-trimmed during the 1990s refurbishment and features dark blue leather over buckets seats for two with matching upholstery over the dash edge, kick panels, and lower portions of the door panels. Features include black rubber floor mats, latch-and-link lap belts, door pull straps, a shifter to the right of the center tunnel, storage pockets on each seatback, an open dash cubby, a dash-mounted rearview mirror, and a radio blanking plate.",
      "The wood-rimmed steering wheel sits ahead of Veglia instrumentation including a 180-km/h speedometer, a 6k-rpm tachometer, and a combination gauge monitoring oil pressure and fuel level. The five-digit odometer shows 9k kilometers (~6k miles), approximately 2,700 of which have been added under current ownership. True mileage is unknown.",
      "The 2,451cc V6 is an evolution of the Francesco de Virgilio-designed power plant that made the Aurelia the first V6-powered production car and features a 60° angle between cylinder banks, an aluminum block, aluminum cylinder heads with hemispherical combustion chambers, and pushrod-driven overhead valves. A Nardi intake manifold and air cleaner were added in the early 2000s, allowing induction through twin Weber 40 DCL5 carburetors. Service performed by Fast Cars of Redondo Beach, California, between 2022 and 2023 included the addition of PerTronix electronic ignition as well as rebuilds of the generator and steering box, a valve adjustment, replacement of the fuel pump, and adjustments to the carburetors.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels via a rear-mounted four-speed manual transaxle, and work between 2022 and 2023 included replacement of the clutch and throwout bearing. The sliding-pillar independent front suspension incorporates coil springs and adjustable shocks contained in oil around vertical pins on either end of a beam axle, while the rear suspension shares the De Dion axle that was introduced on all fourth-series Aurelias. Suspension work during the last three years included rebuilds of the front shocks and rear leaf springs as well as refinishing of various components. The mufflers were replaced in 2022.",

    "description": [
      "This 1966 Shelby Cobra is one of approximately 260 street-specification Mark III examples produced and was billed to Shelby American by AC Cars Limited on March 10, 1966, before being invoiced to Hi-Performance Motors in El Segundo, California, on July 7 of the same year. Chassis 3220 spent its first two decades in California, where it was fitted with a 427ci side-oiler V8 circa the 1970s. After moving to England in 1989, the car underwent a refurbishment that included a conversion to semi-competition specification before returning to the US in 1993. It was purchased by its current owner in 2023 and subsequently underwent an additional refurbishment that included a return to its original shade of Guardsman Blue. Among the S/C-style features are fender flares, a hood scoop, side-pipe exhaust, an oil cooler, adjustable Koni coilover shock absorbers, Halibrand pin-drive wheels, an aluminum trunk floor, a 41-gallon fuel tank, and a roll hoop. Additional equipment includes a four-speed manual transmission, four-wheel disc brakes, black leather upholstery, and a Moto-Lita wood-rimmed steering wheel. This semi-competition-style 427 Cobra is now offered on dealer consignment in Thousand Oaks, California, with photos from the refurbishment and a clean Pennsylvania title.",
      "Shelby introduced the 427 variant of the Cobra in competition trim in 1965 as part of an effort to bolster the model’s racing presence by homologating a big-block-powered version of the platform. Revisions to the AC-built chassis necessitated by the heavier powerplants included 5” of width added to the steel ladder frame, which featured main tubes enlarged to 4” in diameter and rode on a coil-spring suspension in lieu of the earlier Cobra variant’s transverse leaf springs. The street-oriented version of the 427 Cobra arrived in late 1965 and was joined by 31 semi-competition, or S/C, cars derived from unsold competition chassis.",
      "This example’s aluminum bodywork was modified in the style of an S/C model under prior ownership and had been repainted red. The body was reportedly stripped to bare metal and repainted in its original shade of Guardsman Blue during the refurbishment that was completed by H&H Performance in DuBois, Pennsylvania, in 2024, at which time the frame is said to have been media-blasted and refinished in black satin. S/C-style details include rear fender flares, a riveted hood with a scoop, bumper jacks, rectangular taillights, side-exit exhaust with four-into-one collectors, a roll hoop, and a Le Mans-type fuel filler cap. The exhaust was recoated in Cerakote in 2024.",
      "Halibrand pin-drive wheels are secured by three-eared knock-offs and wear Goodyear Blue Streak tires measuring 6.00-15 up front and 8.00-15 at the rear. Stopping is handled by four-wheel disc brakes, while steering is via rack and pinion.",
      "The cockpit houses fixed-back bucket seats trimmed in black leather, while color-keyed carpeting covers the floors. S/C-style touches include a dash absent of defrost vents or a glovebox and the deletion of windshield-washing elements. The trunk compartment was fitted with an aluminum floor over a 41-gallon fuel tank, while the batteries were relocated to the area behind the seats.",
      "The wood-rimmed Moto-Lita steering wheel sits ahead of S/C-style Smiths instrumentation including an 8k-rpm tachometer, a reverse-sweep 180-mph speedometer, and gauges monitoring oil temperature, coolant temperature, amperage, fuel pressure, and oil pressure. The five-digit odometer shows 2,300 miles, approximately 200 of which have been added under current ownership.",
      "The 427ci Ford side-oiler V8 is said to have been installed circa the 1970s in lieu of the car’s original 428ci Police Interceptor engine and is topped by a Holley 780-cfm four-barrel carburetor and a “turkey pan” cold-air box. The lubrication system incorporates an oil cooler.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels via a four-speed manual transmission. The double-wishbone independent suspension setup incorporates adjustable Koni coilover shock absorbers at each corner with an anti-roll bar up front.",
      "The car’s entry in the Shelby registry notes the installation of the side-oiler engine early in the car’s life as well as the S/C-style modifications made circa the 1990s. The registry entry also mentions the car’s appearance in 1990s issues of Cars & Parts and Classic & Sportscar magazines."

    "description": [
      "This 1962 Maserati 3500 GTi was completed in February 1962 before being sold new to an engineer in Milan, Italy, where it was first registered in 1964. Chassis 2078 had made its way to the US by the late 1990s, and in the 2002 was purchased by its current owner, racing driver and author Rich Taylor, who had it fitted with a Chevrolet V8 and a Tremec transmission before using it for participation in various rallies and concours events. A refurbishment performed between 2016 and 2019 included the overhaul and reinstallation of the removed 3,485cc DOHC inline-six with an updated replacement Lucas fuel injection system, an overhaul of the ZF five-speed manual transmission, and a repaint in Rosso Exotico. The car also features a limited-slip differential, four-wheel disc brakes, Borrani disc wheels, independent front suspension, a stainless-steel exhaust system, black leather interior upholstery, power windows, and a push-button AM/FM radio. This Tipo 101 is now offered on dealer consignment in North Salem, New York, with invoices and a clean Florida title describing it as a 1964 model.",
      "The 3500 GT model was first introduced in 1957 and was followed by a revised, fuel-injected GTi variant that was unveiled at the 1960 Geneva Motor Show. The GTi coupe retained its predecessor’s Carrozzeria Touring Superleggera coachwork but integrated styling updates including a slimmer chrome grille surround, rectangular front indicators, front and rear quarter windows, and taillight assemblies with three separate lenses.",
      "Originally finished in Blue Sera, this example received a color change to Rosso Exotico early in its life and was refinished by Davis Auto Body in Copake Falls, New York, during the refurbishment performed between 2016 and 2019. The bumpers were removed in the 2000s, and replacement bumpers were installed during a 2021 refresh by Minisport in Sharon, Connecticut, that also included replacement of the grille.",
      "Silver-painted Borrani disc wheels with alloy rims wear bright replacement hubcaps and are wrapped in 215/70R16 Cooper Evolution Tour tires, while a trunk-mounted spare wears Bridgestone Turanza rubber. Stopping is handled by servo-assisted disc brakes all around, and the brake master cylinder was replaced in 2017.",
      "The cabin was re-trimmed in the 2000s and features black leather over 2+2 seating with matching upholstery over the door panels and upper dash. Additional features include replacement black carpeting, power windows, a lockable glovebox, a Jaeger clock, a cream-color headliner, sun visors, and an AM/FM push-button radio.",
      "The three-spoke steering wheel frames Jaeger instrumentation including a 250-km/h speedometer, an 8k-rpm tachometer, and auxiliary gauges. The five-digit odometer shows 83k kilometers (~52k miles), approximately 50 of which have been added under current ownership.",
      "The 3,485cc DOHC Tipo 101 inline-six features an aluminum block and cylinder head and was overhauled by Restoration and Performance Motorcars in Vermont prior to reinstallation between 2016 and 2017. Work included resurfacing of and welding repairs to the cylinder head, polishing of the crankshaft, reconditioning of the connecting rods, and the installation of replacement pistons, cylinder sleeves, .”010-over main and rod bearings, and valves. The Lucas mechanical fuel injection system was replaced with an updated unit at that time, and a stainless-steel exhaust system was fitted. Additional work included re-coring of the radiator, rebuilds of the starter and generator, and replacement of the oil pump, water pump, and ignition cap and rotor. The fuel pump was replaced in 2021.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels via a ZF five-speed manual transmission that was also overhauled during the 2016 project. The clutch was resurfaced at that time, while the flywheel was balanced and the pilot bearing, release bearing, and clutch master cylinder were replaced. Suspension incorporates double wishbones and coil springs up front and a leaf-sprung solid axle at the rear, with tubular shock absorbers and anti-roll bars at both ends. A freshening in 2021 included replacement of the upper and lower front ball joints as well as the installation of replacement exhaust hangers.",
      "The build sheet lists the original colors, specifications, and equipment numbers. The car’s shipping notice can be viewed in the gallery below, as can Maserati Classiche documents including a Certificate of Origin, a Technical and Aesthetic Characteristics sheet, and a Historical information sheet."

    "description": [
      "This 1960 Bentley S2 is one of 15 examples built with drophead coupe coachwork by H.J. Mulliner and is said to have been constructed for display at the New York International Auto Show in March 1960. Configured in left-hand drive, chassis B75LBR was then delivered new to a Wall Street securities analyst the following month before moving to California with its second owner, with whom it remained until the mid-1990s. The car was purchased by its current owner in 2016 and underwent a freshening in 2021. Finished in white over tan upholstery, the car is powered by a replacement 6.2-liter V8 that breathes through twin SU carburetors and is paired with an automatic transmission. Additional features include power-assisted drum brakes, lever-arm shock absorbers that are adjustable at the rear, power-assisted steering, power windows, air conditioning, and a His Master’s Voice radio. This S2 drophead coupe is now offered on dealer consignment in St. Louis, Missouri, with a factory build sheet, Schoellkopf cards, and Canadian registration.",
      "The S2 was introduced in 1959 as a successor to the S1 and featured power from Rolls-Royce and Bentley’s newly developed V8 powerplant. While most of the 1,863 standard-wheelbase examples of the S2 built wore factory Standard Steel Saloon coachwork, H.J. Mulliner’s two-door, open-roof design appeared on 15 cars, fewer than half of which were configured in left-hand drive such as this example.",
      "Originally finished in Sand, this example wears an older repaint in white with tan coachlining. Features include chrome front and rear bumpers with overriders, Lucas front fog lamps, a fender-mounted antenna, dual side mirrors, and a tan convertible top.",
      "Steel 15” wheels wear chrome covers with body-color rings accented by black pinstripes and are wrapped in 8.20-15 BFGoodrich wide-whitewall tires, as is a spare secured in a compartment under the trunk. Servo-assisted drum brakes feature twin master cylinders handling duplex hydraulic actuation up front and hydromechanical actuation at the rear wheels. The servo is said to have been rebuilt in 2021, while the master cylinders were replaced.",
      "The cabin is trimmed in tan leather over front and rear bench seats, and door panels trimmed in matching upholstery were fabricated during the 2021 refresh. Additional features include color-keyed carpeting, dual-grain wood door caps, fold-out wood trays for the rear passengers, a fold-down rear armrest, front lap belts, power windows, a His Master’s Voice radio, and an aftermarket air-conditioning system with a push-button control panel. The air conditioning is said to have been recharged in 2021. The passenger-side window is said to require assistance going up. The “lower” control knob on the dash does not work, and the heater is not functioning.",
      "The three-spoke steering wheel sits ahead of a dual-grain wood dash that houses Smiths instrumentation including a 120-mph speedometer, a clock, and a combination gauge monitoring oil pressure, amperage, coolant temperature, and fuel level. The five-digit odometer shows 43k miles, approximately 20 of which have been added by the selling dealer.",
      "The replacement 6.2-liter V8 features an aluminum block with cast-iron cylinder liners, aluminum pistons, aluminum cylinder heads with overhead valves, and twin SU carburetors. The fuel pump is said to have been replaced in 2021.",
      "Power is sent to the rear wheels via a column-shifted four-speed automatic transmission. The independent front suspension incorporates coil springs and lever-arm shock absorbers, while the leaf-spring rear axle is equipped with lever-arm shocks that can be adjusted electrically via a switch on the steering column. A stainless-steel exhaust system was reportedly installed during the 2021 refresh.",
      "The factory build sheet lists the H.J. Mulliner coachwork as well as the original colors and equipment.",
      "The vehicle is being sold on its Ontario registration, which serves as the ownership document in Ontario, Canada. The sale does not include a title. It has been imported into the US, and the selling dealer will assist any US-based buyer in obtaining a US title."

      "This 1912 Harley-Davidson X8E was acquired by the selling dealer in 1994 and a subsequent refurbishment is said to have included an overhaul of its 61ci F-head V-twin by the late Mike Parti in addition to sheet metal fabrication and repairs by Jerry DeMille. The bike was refinished in gray with blue, red, and gold stripes and features a Schebler carburetor, a two-into-one exhaust system, and a “town and country” muffler as well as a single-speed transmission, a rear-hub clutch, brown leather Troxel seats, an Old Sol carbide gas headlight, 28″ wire-spoke wheels, a Sager Cushion leading-link fork, a coaster brake, and a rear wheel stand. This “Silent Gray Fellow” is now offered in California for off-road or display purposes only with a 1912 Saskatchewan, Canada, license plate and a bill of sale.",
      "The bike was finished in gray with blue, red, and gold stripes subsequent to sheet metal fabrication and repairs that were performed by Jerry DeMille during the refurbishment. Brown leather Troxel seats consist of a “Ful-Floeting” post-sprung solo saddle and a double-sprung passenger pillion. Additional equipment includes a Hawthorne Old Sol carbide gas generator and illuminator assembly, partially skirted fenders, a front fender mud flap, fixed passenger foot pegs, and a rear wheel stand.",
      "Wire-spoke wheels with gray-painted and red-striped rims are mounted with white 2×28″ Coker Classic button-tread tires that display sidewall cracks. A Sager Cushion leading-link fork with internal springs comprises the bike’s only suspension. A bicycle-style coaster brake provides stopping power.",
      "The pullback handlebar features through-the-bar cable routing for a twist-grip spark-advance on the left and a twist-grip throttle on the right, and an A.W. Rosen pocket watch is mounted on a clamp attached to the handlebar. Leather covers are fitted to the control cables where they exit the handlebar and descend past the steering stem.",
      "Instrumentation consists of an 80-mph Corbin-Brown speedometer that is mounted atop the fuel tank and driven by a “road gear” affixed to the rear sprocket. The five-digit odometer shows one mile, and true mileage is unknown.",
      "The 61ci F-head V-twin is pedal-started and features features inlet–over–exhaust design as well as a total-loss oiling system, a Schebler carburetor, a Bosch magneto ignition, and two-into-one exhaust pipes flowing into a “town and country” muffler with an adjustable outlet. The engine was overhauled by the late Mike Parti during the refurbishment, and the selling dealer states that it has not been started under current ownership.",
      "The bike features a single-speed transmission and a free-wheeling rear-hub clutch operated by a hand lever on the left. The pedal-start chain on the right is retained, while the chain for the final drive on the left has been removed.",
      "The bike does not have a title or registration. It is being sold on a bill of sale only."
